If yes, you are required to submit a copy of your retirement SF-50 (or equivalent). In addition, you must select another eligibility (e.g., Former Federal Employee, VEOA, etc.) for which you can claim on this job opportunity announcement.

Failure to select another eligibility will make you ineligible for consideration.

The Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Navy (DON) policy on employment of annuitants will be used in determining eligibility of annuitants. Annuitants reemployed in the Department of Defense receive full annuity and salary upon appointment. They are not eligible for retirement contributions, to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan, nor to a supplemental or re-determined annuity for the reemployment period. Discontinued service retirement annuitants (i.e. retired under section 8336(d)(1) or 8416(b)(1)(A) of title 5, United States Code) appointed to the Department of Defense may elect to be subject to retirement provisions of the new appointment, as appropriate.

Your Notification of Personnel Action, Standard Form 50 (or equivalent personnel action form) must reflect your status in the competitive service: Position Occupied is 1 in box 34 (Unless you are on a permanent VRA appointment then it will show a 2 in box 34).
