Experience as a graduate DRT is creditable provided the candidate functioned as a DRT and subsequently passed the certification examination.
(3) Part-Time Experience. Part-time experience as a DRT is creditable according to its relationship to the full-time workweek. For example, a DRT would receive one week of full- time credit for each two weeks of half-time work.

Mammography (M). The complex nature of breast disease involves multiple imaging modalities. This specialty involves the specific knowledge and abilities to perform complex imaging of the breast. Mammographers must be able to employ specialized mammographic image techniques such as magnification views and implant views of the breast. The mammographer is required to be completely familiar with, and adhere to, all U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines regulating the practice of mammography, radiation safety, and quality assurance requirements. Mammographers are subject to the Mammography Quality Standards Act of 1992 (MQSA) and regulated by the FDA.
