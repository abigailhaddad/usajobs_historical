Job title Duties (be as detailed as possible)

Please be aware that your answers will be verified against information provided on your resume. Be sure that your resume clearly supports your responses to all of the questions by addressing your work experience in detail.



Recommended: Even though we do not require a specific resume format, your resume must be clear so that we are able to fully evaluate your qualifications. To ensure you receive appropriate consideration, please list the duties you performed under each individual job title. If we are unable to match your experiences with the positions held, you may lose consideration for this vacancy. We cannot make assumptions regarding your qualifications.



Select the appropriate answer to each of the following questions based on your current level of experience that demonstrates your ability to perform the duties of this position.

For selections to General Schedule (GS) or equivalent level positions made from all sources, when more than one applicant for a particular Title 5 NGB and NG civilian attorney position meets the minimum requirements for appointment, the applicant who is best qualified based on relevant experience, education, and achievement in the legal field must be selected. For selectees entering the NGB or NG from outside the civil service, the duties to be performed are the critical factor in determining the grade or pay entrance level. The possession of a degree or high academic standing alone is not a sufficient basis for placement in a higher GS grade and step level, or the equivalent. Excepted service Title 5 NGB and NG civilian attorney positions are exempt from the appointment procedures in reference d. However, NGB and the NG are required to follow the principles of veterans' preference in hiring civilian attorneys as far as administratively possible.


Select “Yes” or “No” to the following question(s).


1.
Does your resume support the Minimum Requirement criteria below?
Attorneys search case reports, legal documents, periodicals, and textbooks, and prepare drafts of letters, memorandums, and legal documents for use by higher-level attorneys. Assignments, while still developmental, involve complex and difficult legal questions requiring extensive research, analysis, and evaluation of information in controversial areas.

Cases have an important impact on major public and private interests, such as cases concerning a major extension or revision in a grant program or a substantial question on civil rights. Cases are vigorously contested by capable legal talent, as in a contracts dispute case. In cases of this scope, attorneys prepare drafts of pleadings and motions in connection with cases in litigation and conduct investigations to obtain facts, study legal precedents, and prepare recommendations while assisting attorneys in charge of court cases by cross-examining witnesses and by drafting findings of fact, conclusions of law, and orders based upon the record. 

Assignments involve extremely complex and difficult legal questions requiring extensive research, analysis, and evaluation of information in controversial scientific, financial, corporate, medical engineering, or other highly technical areas. Cases have an important impact on major private or public interests, such as cases concerning a major extension or revision in a grant program or a substantial question on civil rights. Interest in these cases is usually nationwide.

Attorneys are entrusted with the initial preparation of proposed solutions to projects. They conduct investigations to obtain facts, study legal precedents, make recommendations, and prepare necessary documents. They receive preliminary instructions, their commitment authority is limited, and their completed written work is carefully reviewed.
 Yes
 No


2.
Do you process the requirements to perform at the GS-13 or Equivalent Level criteria below? (Transcripts and Certificates are required to be submitted upon application submission.)

Assignments require the first professional law degree (LL.B. or J.D.), active membership in the bar of the highest court of a State, Territory, or the District of Columbia, and more than two years of professional legal experience that is equal to the duties and responsibilities of the position.

 
 Yes
 No


3.
An applicant for a Title 5 NGB and NG civilian attorney position who is not serving in a current DoD civilian attorney position at the time of selection must provide a certificate from a State agency demonstrating that they have active membership in the bar of the highest court of a State, Territory, or the District of Columbia and are permitted to engage in the active practice of law. Online information provided by the licensing jurisdiction is sufficient if the online information clearly establishes the applicant is permitted to engage in the active practice of law. Information that the applicant is in good standing is not sufficient by itself.

Covered attorneys (Title 5 civilian attorneys employed by the NGB or the NG civilian attorney [or equivalent]) must adhere to the highest standards of professional conduct, including compliance with the rules of professional conduct of the licensing authority of the jurisdictions in which they are members of the bar and with such supplemental requirements as may be established by the NGB General Counsel. A candidate for a covered attorney position has an affirmative obligation to notify the hiring authority, prior to any hiring decision, of any pending or completed disciplinary investigation or action against them in any jurisdiction in which they are or were licensed to practice.

As a condition of this position, you are required to provide a certificate from a State agency demonstrating that they have active membership in the bar of the highest court of a State, Territory, or the District of Columbia and are permitted to engage in the active practice of law. Do you currently possess a valid certificate and can provide evidence of ability to actively practice law?
