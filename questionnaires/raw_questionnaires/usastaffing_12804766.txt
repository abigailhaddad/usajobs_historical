If yes, you are required to submit a copy of your retirement SF-50 (or equivalent). In addition, you must select another eligibility (e.g., Former Federal Employee, VEOA, etc.) for which you can claim on this job opportunity announcement.

Failure to select another eligibility will make you ineligible for consideration.

The Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Navy (DON) policy on employment of annuitants will be used in determining eligibility of annuitants.

They are not eligible for retirement contributions, to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan, nor to a supplemental or re-determined annuity for the reemployment period. Discontinued service retirement annuitants (i.e. retired under section 8336(d)(1) or 8416(b)(1)(A) of title 5, United States Code) appointed to the Department of Defense may elect to be subject to retirement provisions of the new appointment, as appropriate.

4.
Are you currently employed as a permanent competitive service employee in the ORG Code within the Command/UIC listed in the 'This job is open to' section at the top of the job opportunity announcement?

If you are:
Your Notification of Personnel Action, Standard Form 50 will show the UIC number in block 41 (e.g., "UIC:XXXXX) AND
Your Notification of Personnel Action, Standard Form 50 will show the ORG number in block 42 (e.g., "ORG:XXXXX) AND
Your Notification of Personnel Action, Standard Form 50 will reflect career or career-conditional: Tenure 1 or 2 in box 24 AND
Your Notification of Personnel Action, Standard Form 50 must reflect your status in the competitive service: Position Occupied is 1 in box 34 (unless you are on a permanent VRA appointment then it will show a 2 in box 34).

If you answer yes to this question, you are required to submit a copy of your most recent SF-50 showing you are employed at this command in the competitive service AND the SF-50 reflecting the highest grade held if not reflected on your most recent SF-50. Failure to submit this documentation with your application will result in a rating of ineligible.

SF-50s that have an effective date within the past year (e.g., General Adjustment SF-50 from this year or Within Rate/Grade Increases (WRI/WGI) SF-50 within a year) do not clearly show that you meet the one-year time-in-grade requirement. That means if you submit an SF-50 that is dated within the last year, you must submit another SF-50 that is dated more than one year ago to clearly demonstrate you meet the time-in-grade requirements.

If you are a DoD employee, you can obtain a copy of your SF- 50(s) from MyBiz. Failure to provide documentation that fully supports your claim will result in a rating of ineligible.

The letter/certification must be on office letterhead and clearly state your eligibility for the appointing authority under 5 CFR 213.3102 (u). A sample letter can be found here.

7.
Are you the spouse of a relocating Armed Forces member?  If yes, please confirm the following:

I am a military spouse who is currently married to my active duty sponsor. I am exercising my preference eligibility for positions within the local commuting area of my sponsor's current duty station.  I certify that I have not accepted nor declined a permanent, continuing Federal or non-appropriated fund position in the local commuting area of our current duty location. 

NOTE 1:  Military spouses are eligible for one permanent noncompetitive appointment using their preference eligibility for the duration of the active duty sponsor's assignment to a permanent duty station, as long as the military spouse has not declined or accepted a permanent Federal or non-appropriated fund position in the commuting area of the sponsor's current duty location.  If you certify that you have not used your preference at your sponsor's current duty location and it is discovered to be untrue, you may be subject to loss of MSP and possible disciplinary action. 

NOTE 2:  Spouses may exercise their spouse preference and priority status through the application-based process up to 30 calendar days prior to the military sponsor's reporting date to the new duty station or upon relocation anytime thereafter during the sponsor's tour. Spouses who do not initially relocate with their sponsor cannot exercise spouse preference and priority status until they are actually residing in the commuting area of the sponsor's duty station.

NOTE 3:  You must include a completed copy of the UPDATED Military Spouse PPP Self-Certification Checklist found here along with the documents identified on the checklist to verify your eligibility for MSP. Acceptable documentation of your preference eligibility includes at a minimum: A copy of the PCS orders, and your marriage certificate or license.

Failure to provide this documentation will result in a rating of ineligible.
 Yes
 No


8.
TIME IN GRADE
Are you applying for a promotion? It is a promotion if you are applying for a general schedule (GS) position that is higher than the grade level you currently hold or previously held in the past.

To be considered for a promotion, you must provide SF-50(s) that shows that you have held the next lower GS grade for at least one year. SF-50s that have an effective date within the past year (e.g., General Adjustment SF-50 from this year or Within Rate/Grade Increases (WRI/WGI) SF-50 within a year) do not clearly show that you meet the one-year time-in-grade requirement. That means if you submit an SF-50 that is dated within the last year, you must submit another SF-50 that is dated more than one year ago to clearly demonstrate you meet the time-in-grade requirements.
 Yes, I am a GS employee (or have held a GS position within the last 52 weeks) applying for a promotion. I have submitted one or two SF-50(s) that show I have held the next lower GS grade or equivalent (non-GS pay system) for at least one year. If you are a DoD employee, you can obtain a copy of your SF- 50(s) from My Biz at https://compo.dcpds.cpms.osd.mil/
 No, I am a GS employee (or have held a GS position within the last 52 weeks) applying for a GS grade that I currently hold or have held in the past. I have submitted an SF-50 to support this claim. If you are a DoD employee, you can obtain a copy of your SF- 50(s) from MyBiz at https://compo.dcpds.cpms.osd.mil/
 Yes, I am a GS employee (or have held a GS position within the last 52 weeks) applying for a promotion but I have not held the next lower grade or equivalent (non-GS pay system) for at least one year. I was recently promoted to my current grade level within the last year so I do not meet the time-in-grade requirements for promotion.
 No, I am not a GS employee and I have not been a GS employee within the last year (e.g. I am in a pay band, or I am an FWS employee, or I have never worked for the federal government) so this is not applicable to me.
