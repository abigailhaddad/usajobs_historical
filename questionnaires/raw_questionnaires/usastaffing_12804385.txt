Assessment 1
Thank you for your interest in a position with the Department of Justice (DOJ). Your response to this assessment questionnaire, in conjunction with other portions of your completed application, will be evaluated in making screening decisions. This is a DOJ job application system. Your responses in this Assessment Questionnaire are subject to evaluation and verification. Later steps in the selection process are specifically designed to verify your responses. Deliberate attempts to falsify information will be grounds for disqualifying you or for dismissing you from employment following acceptance. Please review your responses for accuracy before you submit this application. Incomplete/incorrect responses may result in you not receiving appropriate consideration.
For the following questions, please select the response that best describes your education and/or experience. You may select only one response for each question. If you feel that your education or experience exceeds all of the descriptions for a particular question, choose the description that is the closest level to the experience or education that you possess. Failure to respond to these questions will result in an ineligible rating.
1. From the descriptions below, select the ONE response that BEST describes the education and/or experience that you possess that demonstrates your ability to perform as a GS-02 Student Trainee (Clerical).

 A. I have at least three (3) months of general experience. General experience is defined as progressively responsible clerical, office, or other work that indicates the ability to perform the duties of a student trainee (clerical). Examples of general experience include: answering an office telephone and referring calls to appropriate staff; filing material in alphabetical, numerical or chronological order; operating a copying machine; collating and stapling materials.
 B. I have graduated from high school (or equivalent).
 C. I do not have the education or experience as described above.
2. Identify the specific experience from your resume or cover letter that validates your response. Also list the name and contact information of someone who can verify your response.

3. From the descriptions below, select the ONE response that BEST describes the education and/or experience that you possess that demonstrates your ability to perform as a GS-03 Student Trainee (Clerical).

 A. I have at least six (6) months of general experience. General experience is defined as progressively responsible clerical, office, or other work that indicates the ability to perform the duties of a student trainee (clerical). Examples of general experience include: answering an office telephone and referring calls to appropriate staff; filing material in alphabetical, numerical or chronological order; operating a copying machine; collating and stapling materials.
 B. I possess at least one (1) year education above high school. This education was obtained in an accredited business, secretarial or technical school, junior college, college or university. (One year of full-time academic study is defined as 30 semester hours, 45 quarter hours, or the equivalent in a college or university, or at least 20 hours of classroom instruction per week for approximately 36 weeks in a business, secretarial, or technical school.)
 C. I have a combination of general experience as described in A and education as described in B which when combined equal 100% of the requirements. To determine if you qualify based on a combination of general experience and education, first determine your education as a percentage; then determine you general experience as a percentage; then add the two percentages. The total percentage must equal at least 100 percent to qualify. For example, if you had 15 semester hours of creditable education. 15 divided by 30 is 50% of the required education. If you also had 3 months of general experience, then 3 divided by 6 is 50% of the required experience. 50%+50% = 100%, therefore, you would qualify for this position.)
 D. I do not have the education or experience as described above.
