Assessment 1
1. I meet the Individual Occupational Requirements for the Hydrology series, 1315 because I have:

 A. Degree: physical or natural science, or engineering that included at least 30 semester hours in any combination of courses in hydrology, the physical sciences, geophysics, chemistry, engineering science, soils, mathematics, aquatic biology, atmospheric science, meteorology, geology, oceanography, or the management or conservation of water resources. The course work must have included at least 6 semester hours in calculus (including both differential and integral calculus), and at least 6 semester hours in physics. Calculus and physics, as described above, are requirements for all grade levels.
 B. Combination of education and experience-- course work as shown in A above, plus appropriate experience or additional education.
 C. I do not meet the Individual Occupational Requirement for the Hydrology series, 1315.
2. In addition to meeting the Individual Occupational Requirements, select the statement that best describes your experience performing the work of a Lead Hydrologist, GS-1315-13 or equivalent grade level in the Federal service.

 A. I have at least one full year (52 weeks) of specialized experience equivalent to the next lower grade level (GS-12) in the Federal service which includes all of the following: Utilizing hydrometeorological techniques and equipment to assist with forecast preparation; Supporting the development of hydrologic modeling and analysis procedures; and Collaborating with customers or partners on hydrologic forecast products and services.
 B. I do not possess the experience described above.
Assessment 2
1. Long-range hydrologic forecasts are used for spring snowmelt flood outlooks and water supply forecasts.

 A. True
 B. False
2. The best process to follow when developing new hydrologic procedures for an operational forecast system is identifying an operational need, reviewing current science, developing and calibrating the procedure against historical data, performing rigorous testing and validation, documenting the methodology, and integrating it into the operational workflow with associated training.

 A. True
 B. False
3. During a rapidly intensifying flood event impacting a river basin, a hydrologic field office is simultaneously processing new radar-derived precipitation data, updating model runs, and receiving urgent calls from emergency managers. To optimize the office's operational response and ensure effective public safety communication, you should direct all available personnel to exclusively focus on verifying every incoming data point, delaying external communications until complete certainty is achieved.

 A. True
 B. False
4. During a rapidly evolving flood situation, a partner calls requesting an immediate update for a river level forecast point. The partner reports the river is already higher than the current forecast and they need to make a decision about evacuating a down stream town. Your hydrologic model has not finished running and you are still waiting on key precipitation data. The most effective course of action is to acknowledge their report, run the model with the information available at the time, and provide the best information along with the current river trends but stress that this is still preliminary and let the partner know when to expect more complete information.

 A. True
 B. False
5. Providing the new forecaster with system logins and a set of procedural manuals, allowing them to learn independently by observing senior staff from a distance is the most effective process for providing on-the-job training to new forecasters.

 A. True
 B. False
Select “Yes” or “No” to the following question(s).
6. I certify that I did not use a consultant or artificial intelligence tool (such as a large language model) to complete the responses above.

I understand that providing false or misleading information may result in disqualification from consideration or termination of employment if hired.

I further certify that I have read the entire vacancy announcement, reviewed my responses to the eligibility questions for accuracy, and understand the requirements regarding supporting documentation, including what must be submitted and applicable deadlines.

 A. Yes
 B. No
