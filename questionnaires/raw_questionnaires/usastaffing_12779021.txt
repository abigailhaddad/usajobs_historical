Then select one statement that best describes your experience and/or education as it relates to the additional qualification requirements for GS-7 Auditor position. Please read all of the statements carefully and completely before making your selection. Select only ONE statement.
 A. I have at least one year of professional accounting, auditing, or related experience comparable to the GS-5 level in the Federal service. Specialized experience is working as a trainee accountant or auditor performing relatively simple audit steps and tasks such as examining routine financial documents, preparing simple summaries and schedules, and organizing work paper files.

 C. I have completed at least one full academic year of graduate education in an accredited college or university in either accounting or auditing or in a directly related field such as business administration, finance/banking, or public administration that provided the knowledge, skill, and ability to do the work of an accountant or auditor. One academic year of graduate education is considered to be the number of credit hours that your graduate school has determined to represent one academic year of full-time study. Such study may have been performed on a full-time or part-time basis.

 D. I have a combination of graduate level education as described in B above and specialized experience as described in C above which can be combined to equal one year. To compute this, first determine your total qualifying experience as a percentage of the experience required under letter C above. (For example, 6 months of professional experience equals 50% of the experience requirement.) Then, determine your graduate education as a percentage of the education required under B above. (For example, 9 semester hours of creditable graduate work equals 50% of the education required.) Add the two percentages together. The total must equal at least 100 percent to qualify.
 E. I do not possess the education and/or experience in the amounts specified in any of the above statements.
3. In addition to meeting the Basic Education Requirement, you must also meet the specialized experience requirement to qualify at the GS-9 grade level. Review all of the statements below.

Specialized experience is performing audit steps and tasks of limited difficulty and complexity such as conducting evaluations, examinations, or other fact-finding studies and preparing draft audit reports using a practical application of auditing standards, procedures, and technology.
 B. I have a master's degree or have completed two full academic years of progressively higher level graduate education leading to a master's degree or higher in accounting, auditing, or directly related field such as business administration or finance which provided me with the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to satisfactorily perform GS-9 Auditor work.
 C. I have a combination of graduate level education as described in B above in excess of the first year and specialized experience as described in A above which can be combined to meet the one year requirement. To compute this, first determine your total qualifying experience as a percentage of the experience required under A above. (For example, 6 months of professional experience equals 50% of the experience requirement.) Then, determine your graduate education as a percentage of the education required under B above. Only graduate level education beyond the first full academic year can be used in this calculation. (For example, 27 semester hours of creditable graduate work equals 50% of the education required.) Add the two percentages together. The total must equal at least 100 percent to qualify.
 D. I do not possess the education and/or experience in the amounts specified in any of the above statements.
4. In addition to meeting the Basic Education Requirement, you must also meet the specialized experience requirement to qualify at the GS-11 grade level. Review all of the statements below.
