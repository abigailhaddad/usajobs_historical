Conditions of Employment, Requirements and Suitability
12.
A Criminal Investigator can expect to work approximately 50 hours per week. In addition, Criminal Investigators are subjected to callouts at all hours; long-term investigations that will require you to work nights, weekends and holidays; and travel which will require you to be away several days.

INSTRUCTIONS: Law enforcement officers and agents are held to a high standard of honesty, integrity and credibility due to the need of public trust and confidence attendant to their job responsibilities. One of these responsibilities is the requirement to testify at criminal trials. Under GIGLIO v. United States 405 U.S. 150, investigative agencies must turn over to prosecutors any potential impeachment evidence with respect to agents/officers involved in court cases. In testifying, an agent/officer's credibility, character of truthfulness and reputation could be used to cast substantial doubt on the evidence and facts of these criminal cases. Keeping this in mind, please answer the next two questions.


24.
Is there anything that would prevent you from testifying in the court of law?
 Yes
 No


25.
Are you aware of any information regarding your credibility, integrity and/or honesty that may impair your ability to testify in criminal proceedings?
 Yes
 No


26.
Have you ever been made aware of that any government attorney did not want you to testify on behalf of the government due to concerns under Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972) (i.e., that you are Giglio impaired)?
 Yes, I have been made aware of being Giglio impaired; however, I have been made aware that the government no longer considers me Giglio impaired.
 Yes, I have been made aware of and I am currently Giglio impaired.
 No, I have never been made aware of being Giglio impaired.


27.
Have you ever participated in a federal polygraph examination in conjunction with a pre-employment hiring process?
 Yes, I have participated in a federal polygraph examination.
 No, I have never participated in a federal polygraph examination.


28.
If you chose response A in the previous question, provide the approximate date and agency which conducted the polygraph examination, otherwise write "N/A."
