Assessment 1
7.
Task: Communicates with lead or supervisor on any concerns related to supplies, equipment and procedures.

Which of the following concerns requires immediate communication to a lead or supervisor?

 A routine, non-critical supply item is on backorder for two days.
 A clinical area has requested a larger quantity of a common, non-critical supply.
 A significant inventory discrepancy is found for a critical, life-sustaining medical item that cannot be immediately located.
 The barcoding scanner is functioning slower than usual and causing minor delays.


8.
Task: Provides information to customers or external stakeholders regarding medical supplies.

A nurse asks the technician if a specific sterile dressing is appropriate for a particular type of wound. The technician should:
 Refer the nurse to the product's official instructions or a clinical expert (like a product specialist), as providing clinical advice is outside the supply technician's scope of practice.
 Offer a personal opinion based on which dressings are most frequently ordered by that clinical area.
 State that they are only responsible for delivery and cannot answer any questions about clinical use.
 Advise the nurse to try it and see if it works for the patient.


9.
Task: Escalates complex or unresolvable issues to the supervisor or more senior staff.

A technician discovers a recurring inventory discrepancy for a high-value item that they cannot resolve after performing standard search and reconciliation procedures. The appropriate next step is to:

 Continue investigating for another week before reporting the issue.
 Make a one-time adjustment in the inventory system to match the physical count and hope the issue resolves itself.
 Document the unresolved discrepancy, along with the attempted resolution steps, and formally escalate the issue to a supervisor or senior technician.
 Ask a technician from a different department what they would do to fix the record.


10.
Task: Works with customers to resolve supply management issues including receiving requests, clarifying user requirements, explaining delays, expediting deliveries and resolving problems.

A clinical area reports that a critical supply shipment was significantly delayed, impacting patient care. The technician's best response to resolve this issue is to:

 Inform the customer that delays are common and unavoidable due to staffing issues.
 Suggest the customer submit their requests earlier next time to avoid the issue.
 Acknowledge the problem, investigate the cause of the delay, and provide the customer with an accurate explanation and a revised delivery schedule/ETA.
 Immediately blame the delay on the shipping department or an external vendor without offering a clear solution.


The following statements pertain to Technology Application (Uses machines, tools, or equipment effectively; uses computers and computer applications/systems to analyze and communicate information in the appropriate format.)


11.
Task: Ensures data integrity of the inventory management system.

To ensure data integrity, when a technician removes an item from the shelf for distribution, the mandatory action is to:

 Write down the item number on a piece of paper to enter into the system later.
 Immediately scan or enter the transaction into the inventory management system to ensure the change in stock level is reflected in real-time.
 Tell their shift partner to enter the information for them at the end of the day.
 Assume the system will automatically know the item has been removed because of the scheduled inventory scan.


12.
Utilizes computerized systems including bar-coding and automated inventory systems for the delivery and inventory control of supplies.

The primary purpose of using a bar-coding system for inventory control during delivery is to:

 Increase accuracy and efficiency by electronically capturing item data, reducing manual entry errors and providing an audit trail.
 Create a record of how quickly the technician can move through the warehouse aisles.
 Track the physical location of the technician within the facility throughout the shift.
 Eliminate the need for physical shelf labels and bin identifiers.


13.
Task: Utilizes an automated inventory system to monitor issues and receipts in support of stock replenishment processes.

A technician monitors the automated inventory system and sees that the stock level for gloves has reached its "reorder point." This system notification indicates that:

 It is time to initiate the stock replenishment process to order more gloves before the existing supply is depleted.
 It is time to physically count the item on the shelves to verify the system's stock level before any other action is taken.
 The gloves currently in stock are about to expire.
 The hospital has completely run out of gloves and an emergency order must be placed.


14.
Task: Ensures data accuracy in the automated system.

To ensure data accuracy, if a technician notices that the physical description of an item on the shelf does not match the description in the automated system, they should:

 Change the description in the system themselves and then notify a supervisor.
 Assume the shelf label is wrong and ignore the discrepancy for now.
 Report the data discrepancy to a supervisor or Inventory Management Specialist for investigation and authorized correction.
 Remove the item from the shelf so no one uses it until the issue is resolved.


15.
Task: Performs daily inventory using bar coding equipment on a predetermined schedule.

Performing inventory on a predetermined schedule, rather than randomly, is important because:

 It ensures that all technicians are equally sharing the workload and coverage.
 It allows the bar coding equipment to be recharged at the same time every day.
 The system is designed to only accept inventory scans at certain times of the day.
 A consistent schedule provides reliable and timely consumption data, which is essential for maintaining proper stock levels and preventing shortages.


The following statements pertain to Attention to Detail (Is thorough when performing work and conscientious about attending to detail.)


16.
Task: Delivers supplies in a timely and accurate manner, ensures supplies and material are delivered in sterile and operational condition.

While delivering a sterile supply package, the technician notices a small water stain on the outer wrap. The action that demonstrates the highest level of attention to detail regarding sterility is to:

 Immediately consider the sterile barrier compromised, withhold the package from use, and return it to Sterile Processing (SPS) for reprocessing.
 Deliver the item but ask the receiving nurse to inspect the inner seal before accepting it.
 Use a piece of clean tape to cover the water stain and proceed with the delivery.
 Deliver the item since the water stain is small and likely did not penetrate the inner layer.


17.
Task: Ensures critical supplies are appropriately monitored and controlled.

Appropriate monitoring and control of a critical supply item (e.g., high-value or highly sensitive material) requires the technician to:

 Place the item in a location that is visually monitored by a surveillance camera.
 Store the item in a physically secured location (e.g., locked cabinet) and maintain a verifiable, auditable transaction log for every issue and receipt.
 Perform a physical count of the item once a week and report the total to the supervisor.
 Designate the item as "critical" in the system and rely on automated alarms for control.


18.
Task: Checks inventory for stock identified for recalled items and hazard alerts.

Upon receiving a hazard alert for a specific lot number of IV tubing, the technician's immediate priority demonstrating attention to detail and safety is to:

 Physically locate and immediately quarantine all stock with the affected lot number, apply a "Do Not Use" label, and update its status in the inventory system.
 Check the computerized inventory system to confirm the item is still stocked before checking the shelves.
 Wait for the Logistics Lead to confirm the recall notice before taking physical action on the shelves.
 Continue stocking the item for patient use until the full replacement shipment has been received.


19.
Task: Monitors expiration dates, rotates stock to limit outdates and removes items from use as required by outdates.

When stocking a shelf with a new shipment of medical supplies, the technician must practice proper stock rotation by:

 Placing the stock that arrived first at the front of the shelf to ensure it is used first (FIFO - First In, First Out).
 Identifying the stock with the earliest expiration date and placing it at the front of the shelf so it is consumed first (FEFO - First Expired, First Out).
 Placing the newest stock (latest expiration) at the front because it is less likely to be damaged.
 Mixing the old and new stock together to ensure a balanced inventory look.
