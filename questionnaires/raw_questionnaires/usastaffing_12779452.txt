Please follow all instructions carefully; errors or omissions can affect your rating.

To receive credit for experience, your resume MUST clearly indicate the nature of the duties and responsibilities for each position, starting and ending dates of employment (MUST include beginning and ending month/year e.g., 5/2019-10/2019 or 5/10/2019-10/20/2019), and the resume must reflect full and/or part-time or total number of hours worked (i.e., work 40+ hours a week, rather than indicating full-time).

Assessment 1
1. From the descriptions below, select the response that best describes how your experience meets the minimum qualification requirement for this position at the GS-05 level. Read all responses before making your selection. Your resume must clearly support the response you selected or you will be rated as not qualified. If you leave this question blank you will be rated ineligible. If you do not meet these minimum qualifications, you will be considered not qualified and will not receive consideration for this position.

 A. I have one year of specialized experience comparable in scope and responsibility to at least the GS-04 grade level in the Federal service. Specialized experience demonstrates the knowledge, skills, and abilities to perform successfully the duties of an Office Automation Assistant. For this position specialized experience is progressively responsible clerical, office, or other work that includes using software programs such as, word processing, spreadsheet, or database (e.g., Excel, Access, Word, or similar operating systems); providing information or assistance to the public in a business or recreation setting; and compiling and analyzing information to report. My resume shows where, when, and how I performed these duties.
 B. I have successfully completed four years of education above the high school level in any field for which high school graduation or the equivalent was a prerequisite. This education was obtained in an accredited business, secretarial or technical school, junior college, college, or university. One year of full-time academic study is defined as 30 semester hours, 45 quarter hours, or the equivalent in a college or university, or at least 20 hours of classroom instruction per week for approximately 36 weeks in a business, secretarial, or technical school. IMPORTANT - PLEASE NOTE: If you are using education to qualify, you must submit a copy of your transcripts.
 C. I have NOT completed 1 full year of specialized experience as described in option A above or the education as indicated in option B above, but I have equivalent combinations of experience and education as described above. NOTE: Only education in excess of the first 60 semester hours (i.e., beyond the second year is creditable toward meeting the specialized experience requirement). One full academic year of study {30 semester hours or 45 quarter hours) beyond the second year is equivalent to 6 months of specialized experience. For example, I have 6 months of the specialized experience described in A above (50% of the experience requirement), and 3 years of college study from an accredited institution (50% of the qualifying education). IMPORTANT - PLEASE NOTE: If you are using education to qualify, you must submit a copy of your transcripts.
 D. I do not meet or exceed any of the above statements.
