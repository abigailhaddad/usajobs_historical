            <h4>Privacy Policy</h4>
            <p>
                Thank you for visiting the USA Staffing web site and reviewing our privacy policy. We collect no personal information about you when you visit our Web site unless you choose to provide that information to us. Also, we are committed to maintaining the privacy of your personal information and the security of our computer system. With respect to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information, USA Staffing makes every effort to ensure compliance with applicable Federal law, including but not limited to, the Privacy Act of 1974, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, and the Freedom of Information Act.
            </p>

            <h4>Information Collected and Stored Automatically</h4>
            <p>
                If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the Web site, read pages, or download information, the Web reporting software collects and stores the following information about your visit automatically. This information does not identify you personally.
                <ul>
                    <li>The IP address from which you access our Web site (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web);</li>
                    <li>The type of browser and operating system used to access our site;</li>
                    <li>The date and time you access our site;</li>
                    <li>The pages you visit; and</li>
                    <li>The Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly to USA Staffing.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h4>Providing Personal Information</h4>
            <p>
                If you provide us with personally identifiable information (name, email address, Social Security Number, Username, your Password or other unique identifier) this information is used only in connection with USA Staffing and for such purposes as are described at the point of collection. We only share the information you give us with another government agency if your transaction relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law. Information is collected for statistical purposes, and for history reports required to document the transactions you complete through USA Staffing. Also, USA Staffing sometimes performs analyses of user behavior in order to measure customer interest in the various areas of our site. We will disclose this information to third parties only in aggregate form. We do not collect information for commercial marketing.
            </p>

            <h4>Cookies</h4>
            <p>
                "Cookies" are small bits of text which are either used for the duration of a session ("session cookies"), or saved on a user's hard drive in order to identify that user, or information about that user, the next time the user logs on to a website ("persistent cookies"). The Office of Personnel Management and its program sites may use Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 cookies as defined in the <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/memoranda_2010/m10-22.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Office of Management and Budget memorandum</a>.
            </p>
            <p>  USA Staffing utilizes web measurement technology in order to improve our website and provide a better user experience for our customers. The Office of Management and Budget classifies this as a Tier 2 usage, since we are utilizing a multi-session web measurement technology that does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII). This technology anonymously tracks how visitors interact with opm.gov, including where they came from, what they did on the site, and whether they completed any pre-determined tasks while on the site.</p>
            <p> This technology is provided by Google Analytics and the information collected is used to optimize our website; helping us determine top tasks, improve our user interface and diversify our content offerings to meet the needs of our customers. No personally identifiable information is collected, so the anonymity of the end user is protected. The measurement data that is collected is only retained for as long as is needed for proper analysis and optimization of the website and is accessible only to employees whose position necessitates it.</p>
            <p> Since disabling this web measurement technology requires modifying individual browser settings it is enabled by default. If you wish to opt-out of this technology, you can find step-by-step instructions for changing your settings at <a href="http://www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml</a>.</p>
            <p>  Google also provides a browser plug-in that will allow you to opt-out of all Google Analytics measurements, which you can find at <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout </a>. Please note that opting-out in no way affects your access to content within opm.gov or how you see the site.</p>
            <p>
                OPM may make very limited use of some Tier 3 persistent cookies to allow cross session and website authentication. OPM will make notice of the use of such technologies on the application or websites employing them and inform the user to opt-in to allow the Tier 3 cookie to be set before engaging USA Staffing. USA Staffing does make use of persistent cookies from USAJOBS to determine if you are already authenticated with USAJOBS when you access the site.
            </p>      
            <h4>Site Security</h4>
            <p>
                You must enter personally identifiable information (Username and Password) to access USA Staffing. For added security, the system does not display your Username and Password when signing on the system. We ensure that our Web site remains available to all users by employing software programs and hardware devices to monitor network traffic. This aids in identifying unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.
            </p>
            <h4>Links to Other Sites</h4>
            <p>
                Our Web site has links to other Federal agency Web sites. We also link to other organizations’ Web sites when we have a good business reason to do so. This does not constitute an endorsement of their privacy act policies or products. Once you link to another site, you are subject to the privacy policy of the new site. In addition, you will not be able to return to USA Staffing without re-entering your personally identifiable information.
