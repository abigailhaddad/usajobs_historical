Assessment 1
Please select the responses to the questions below that best describes your experience as it relates to this position.
1. I meet the Individual Occupational Requirements for the Computer Engineering series, 0854 because I have:
 A. Degree: Engineering. To be acceptable, the program must: (1) lead to a bachelor's degree in a school of engineering with at least one program accredited by ABET; or (2) include differential and integral calculus and courses (more advanced than first-year physics and chemistry) in five of the following seven areas of engineering science or physics: (a) statics, dynamics; (b) strength of materials (stress-strain relationships); (c) fluid mechanics, hydraulics; (d) thermodynamics; (e) electrical fields and circuits; (f) nature and properties of materials (relating particle and aggregate structure to properties); and (g) any other comparable area of fundamental engineering science or physics, such as optics, heat transfer, soil mechanics, or electronics. OR
 B. Combination of education and experience -- college-level education, training, and/or technical experience that furnished (1) a thorough knowledge of the physical and mathematical sciences underlying engineering, and (2) a good understanding, both theoretical and practical, of the engineering sciences and techniques and their applications to one of the branches of engineering. The adequacy of such background must be demonstrated by one of the following: 1. Professional registration or licensure -- Current registration as an Engineer Intern (EI), Engineer in Training (EIT)1, or licensure as a Professional Engineer (PE) by any State, the District of Columbia, Guam, or Puerto Rico. Absent other means of qualifying under this standard, those applicants who achieved such registration by means other than written test (e.g., State grandfather or eminence provisions) are eligible only for positions that are within or closely related to the specialty field of their registration. For example, an applicant who attains registration through a State Board's eminence provision as a manufacturing engineer typically would be rated eligible only for manufacturing engineering positions. 2. Written Test -- Evidence of having successfully passed the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE)2 examination or any other written test required for professional registration by an engineering licensure board in the various States, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico. 3. Specified academic courses -- Successful completion of at least 60 semester hours of courses in the physical, mathematical, and engineering sciences and that included the courses specified in the basic requirements under paragraph A. The courses must be fully acceptable toward meeting the requirements of an engineering program as described in paragraph A. 4. Related curriculum -- Successful completion of a curriculum leading to a bachelor's degree in an appropriate scientific field, e.g., engineering technology, physics, chemistry, architecture, computer science, mathematics, hydrology, or geology, may be accepted in lieu of a bachelor's degree in engineering, provided the applicant has had at least 1 year of professional engineering experience acquired under professional engineering supervision and guidance. Ordinarily there should be either an established plan of intensive training to develop professional engineering competence, or several years of prior professional engineering-type experience, e.g., in interdisciplinary positions. (The above examples of related curricula are not all-inclusive.)
 C. I do not meet the Individual Occupational Requirement for the Computer Engineering series, 0854.
2. Select the one statement that best describes the experience that you possess that demonstrates your ability to perform the work of a Computer Engineer (Cyber) at the GS-12 grade level in the Federal service.
 A. I have one year of specialized experience equivalent to the GS-11 level in the Federal service which includes: 1) Experience designing, implementing and maintaining a Zero Trust security framework within the DoD environments. This includes focusing on all seven pillars of Zero Trust and engineering and implementing projects to meet milestone dates for target and advanced level activities. 2) Experience configuring and optimizing boundary protection mechanisms such as Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS), Next Generation Firewalls, Web Application Firewalls, Network Data Loss Prevention Systems, Authentication- Authorization-Auditing Systems (AAA), Network Multi Factor Authentication, Forward Proxy and Reverse Proxy. 3) Experience delivering and managing Boundary protection solutions and services to a large enterprise, encompassing technical systems, processes, and procedures. 4) Experience configurating and optimizing continuous monitoring tools. 5) Experience implementing security measures for cloud-based DoD environments and enterprise systems to enable secure cross-platform interactions. 6) Experience configuring and optimizing network automation, analytics and forensics tools.
 B. I do not possess the experience described above.
