6. WG-2610-12:  Must have at least the AFSC 2A354, with 12+ months of work experience or training demonstrating the ability to repair, align, and adjust major integrated electronic systems such as inertial navigation system, automatic flight control, or fire control system. Extensive knowledge of electronic, pneumatic, hydraulic, and mechanical systems in order to understand and predict the progressive effects of malfunctions throughout the interrelated units, (e.g., trace an apparent operating error in the hydraulic controls of a gun mount back to the failure of a tactical computer to integrate yaw, pitch, azimuth, and velocity inputs) and to predict areas of technical difficulty in order to assist lower grade employees. Through knowledge of the application of electronic theories and practices to one or more complex integrated systems such as fire control, inertial navigation, or automatic landing control systems. Broad knowledge of such applications as radar, digital or analog computers, digital or cathode ray tube display devices, etc., and specific knowledge of the technology and practices which integrate these components into a total functional system. Knowledge of mathematics including algebra and basic trigonometric functions in order to adapt standard formulas to the specific requirements of the integrated system. Ability to follow drawings for integrated electronic systems such as radar navigation systems which integrate terrain information from the radar, pitch, roll, and turn rate, etc. from sensing devices and actuate control relays. Ability to trace the effect of a change in one subsystem to other integrated subsystems and determine which controls and devices must be changed or adjusted to compensate. Ability to diagnose and determine needed repairs for malfunctions in electronics systems such as weapons control where knowledge of the entire system is necessary to interpret error data and trace back through a number of units of the system to locate the deficiency.

Do you meet the above qualification standard?
 A. Yes
 B. No
7. WG-2610-13: Must have at least the AFSC 2A374 with 12+ months of specialized experiences working as an Electronic Integrated Systems Mechanic, WG-2610-12, and the following specialized experience or training demonstrating the ability to repair, overhaul, rebuild, align, and adjust complete multi-systems such as the electronics package in a highly automated aircraft where target acquisition and tracking, weapons control, aircraft attitude control, navigation, and other complex functions are performed by numerous systems which are extensively interconnected with data feedback loops. Applies comprehensive knowledge of all major units of the complete multisystem, i.e., how they function independently, how they are interfaced in the integrated subsystems, and how the subsystems interact to achieve operating specifications. Able to determine proper sequence of operations and start point in sequential operations in order to pinpoint areas of malfunction. Extensive practical knowledge of the theories and practices of electromagnetic propagation, electronic circuits, computer theory, hydraulic or pneumatic control and power systems, and many other areas covering a wide range of system applications. Broad knowledge of the interactions among a number of closely integrated complex systems. Knowledge of mathematics, including trigonometry, to calculate power relation ships, signal phasing, etc. Ability to interpret drawings for multisystem complexes such as the complete electronics package for an aircraft including numerous interconnections of signal paths both between and within individual subsystems of the multisystem complex. Ability to isolate malfunctions of complete multiple integrated systems consisting of closely interrelated fire control, bombing-navigation, flight control, countermeasures or similar systems and to determine the methods of repair where extremely complex relationships exist among numerous interconnected units and control circuits not only within the individual control systems but between them as well, requiring complete knowledge of all electronic, mechanical, and or optical systems and units. Performs on-equipment or off-equipment maintenance on one or more complete electronic integrated systems associated with the assigned aircraft, and/or maintenance on automatic flight control systems, instrument systems, inertial and radar navigation systems.

Assessment 1
Respond to all statements and questions. These statements and questions allow applicants to highlight their Knowledge, Skills and Abilities (KSAs) which are applicable to the position for which you are applying. If it is necessary to limit the number of applicants for a position, these KSAs will be used to determine the "Best Qualified".  For each KSA please identify below in the space provided how you have either demonstrated the KSA or have shown the potential to acquire them. Give specific examples describing related project, details, work assignments, outside activities, and the time frames involved in each. If you do not answer these statements and questions an accurate evaluation of your qualifications may not be possible. This may result in your application not being certified.

1. Knowledge of electronic theories and practices of integrated electronic, pneumatic, hydraulic, optical, and mechanical systems of such applications as digital or analog computers, digital display devices which enables the incumbent to understand and predict the effects of subsystem malfunctions on the total function system.
2. Ability to apply electronic theories and practices to identify, isolate and repair malfunctions in one or more complex integrated systems where knowledge of the entire system is necessary to interpret error data and trace problems back through a number of units of the system to locate deficiencies.
3. Ability to interpret/trace schematics, logic/wiring diagrams and use a wide variety of test, measurement, and diagnostic equipment (TMDE).
4. Knowledge of the technology and practices which integrate the components of the systems into a total functional system.
5. Skill in the set up and operation of computer controlled test equipment such as Portable Automated Test Station (PATS), Joint Service Electronic Combat System Tester (JSECST),test stands, oscilloscopes (dual trace, storage, digitized), spectrum, network and distortion analyzers, frequency counters, and signal generators.
