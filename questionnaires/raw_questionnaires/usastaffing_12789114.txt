You should be aware that your ratings are subject to evaluation and verification based on the resume, and other relevant documents you submit, as well as through verification of references as appropriate. Deliberate attempts to falsify information may be grounds for disqualifying you or for dismissing you from the position following acceptance. The following questions will be used to determine your minimum qualifications for this position.
1. Carefully read the following descriptions of experience and education. Select the one that best describes your qualifications for the GS-09 Public Affairs Specialist. Make sure your resume supports the response that you select. Mark only 1 response.
 A. I have at least one year (52 weeks) of specialized experience, in a pay or work status, equivalent in difficulty and complexity to the GS-07 level in the Federal service. This experience must demonstrate all of the following: *Using social media platforms (such as: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, X formerly known as Twitter) to share pre-approved announcements or updates on behalf of an organization, business, school, nonprofit, or community group; AND *Assisting in the preparation or delivering of briefings, announcements, or community updates to customers, community groups, or local audiences; AND *Establishing and maintaining relationships with community groups, local officials, or media representatives.
