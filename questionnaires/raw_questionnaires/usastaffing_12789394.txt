Assessment 1
Thank you for your interest in a position with the Department of Justice (DOJ). Your response to this assessment questionnaire, in conjunction with other portions of your completed application, will be evaluated in making screening decisions. This is a DOJ job application system. Your responses in this Assessment Questionnaire are subject to evaluation and verification. Later steps in the selection process are specifically designed to verify your responses. Deliberate attempts to falsify information will be grounds for disqualifying you or for dismissing you from employment following acceptance. Please review your responses for accuracy before you submit this application. Incomplete/incorrect responses may result in you not receiving appropriate consideration.
For the following questions, please select the response that best describes your education and/or experience. You may select only one response for each question. If you feel that your education or experience exceeds all of the descriptions for a particular question, choose the description that is the closest level to the experience or education that you possess. Failure to respond to these questions will result in an ineligible rating.
1. From the descriptions below, select the response that best describes the education and/or experience that you possess that demonstrates your ability to perform as a GS-09 Budget Analyst.

 A. I have at least one (1) full year of specialized experience equivalent to the GS-07 level in Federal service. My qualifying experience involved performing budget or financial management work which demonstrates a knowledge of budget and finance policies, principles, and practices sufficient to assist with the budget process. Examples of specialized experience include monitoring and tracking obligations and expenditures and ensuring they are properly maintained; reviewing obligating documents for funds availability and regulatory compliance; tracking funds; inputting data into an automated financial/budget system; processing bills for payments while resolving problems or disputed bills; conducting audits; gathering statistical data needed for financial reporting; and developing budget reports.
 B. I possess one of the following types of education in a related field (e.g., Finance, Accounting, Financial Management, Business Administration): a Master's or equivalent graduate degree; or 2 full years of progressively higher level graduate education leading to such a degree; or LL.B or J.D., if related. My education was obtained in an accredited college or university and demonstrates the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to perform the duties of a Budget Analyst.
 C. I have a combination of specialized experience as described in A and graduate education as described in B which when combined equal 100% of the requirements. (Only graduate education in excess of 1 full year is creditable. To calculate your percentage of graduate education, first determine the total number of graduate level hours that exceed 18 semester hours or your school's definition of one full year of graduate study. Then divide the total number of your excess graduate semester hours by 18 or your school's definition of one year of graduate study. To calculate your percentage of qualifying experience, divide your total number of months of qualifying experience by 12. Now, add the two percentages together. The sum of the percentages must equal at least 100%. For example, if you had 9 months of specialized experience equivalent to the GS-7, then you would have 75% of the required experience. If you also had 27 semester hours of creditable graduate level education, then 27-18=9 semester hours. 9 divided by 18 is 50% of the required education, and therefore, 75% + 50% = 125%. You would qualify for this position.)
 D. My experience and/or education is not reflected in any of the above statements.
2. Identify the specific experience from your resume or cover letter that validates your response. Also list the name and contact information of someone who can verify your response.

3. From the descriptions below, select the response that best describes the education and/or experience that you possess that demonstrates your ability to perform as a GS-11 Budget Analyst.

 A. I have at least one (1) full year of specialized experience equivalent to the GS-09 level in Federal service. My qualifying experience involved performing budget or financial management work which demonstrates an intensive knowledge of budget and finance policies, principles, and practices sufficient to manage the budget process. Examples of specialized experience include formulating and executing the budget; supporting financial management operations; conducting audits, tracking funds, and developing statistical reports.
 B. I possess one of the following types of education in a related field (e.g., Finance, Accounting, Financial Management, Business Administration): a Ph.D. or equivalent doctoral degree; or 3 full years of progressively higher-level graduate education leading to such a degree; or LL.M, if related. My education was obtained in an accredited college or university and demonstrates the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to perform the duties of a Budget Analyst.
 C. I have a combination of specialized experience as described in A and graduate education as described in B which when combined equal 100% of the requirements. (Only graduate education in excess of 2 full years is creditable. To calculate your percentage of graduate education, first determine the total number of graduate level hours that exceed 36 semester hours or your school's definition of two full years of graduate study. Then divide the total number of your excess graduate semester hours by 18 or your school's definition of one year of graduate study. To calculate your percentage of qualifying experience, divide your total number of months of qualifying experience by 12. Now, add the two percentages together. The sum of the percentages must equal at least 100%. For example, if you had 9 months of specialized experience equivalent to the GS-9, then you would have 75% of the required experience. If you also had 45 semester hours of creditable graduate level education, then 45-36=9 semester hours. 9 divided by 18 is 50% of the required education, and therefore, 75% + 50% = 125%. You would qualify for this position.)
 D. My experience and/or education is not reflected in any of the above statements.
4. Identify the specific experience from your resume or cover letter that validates your response. Also list the name and contact information of someone who can verify your response.
