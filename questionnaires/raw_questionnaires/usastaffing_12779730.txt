Be sure that your resume clearly supports your responses to all the questions by addressing your work experience in detail. Recommended: Even though we do not require a specific resume format, your resume must be clear so that we are able to fully evaluate your qualifications. To ensure you receive appropriate consideration, please list the duties you performed under each individual job title. If we are unable to match your experiences with the positions held, you may lose consideration for this vacancy. We cannot make assumptions regarding your qualifications.
Document Reminder - Please ensure that you have uploaded all eligibility documents (ex. VA Disability letter, DD-214, Schedule-A letter, etc.) AND the EPA certification.
SF-50, Notification of Personnel Action (for Eligibility and/or Time-in-Grade): For former and current employees ONLY, if this does not apply to you, please disregard.

If you are a current federal employee, you must attach your most recent, non-award SF-50. This SF-50 should not be more than a year old and must show your current position, grade, and step. Award SF-50's typically do not provide sufficient information and will not be accepted if they do not include Grade and Step.

Though Wage Grade positions do not have a time-in-grade requirement, all internal applicants MUST provide their most recent SF-50 (DATED WITHIN THE LAST YEAR) in order to show their ELIGIBILITY as a current employee for internal postings.

PLEASE CONTACT THE HR SPECIALIST LISTED ON THE ANNOUNCMENT IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THE PROPER SF-50S. NO EXCEPTIONS WILL BE MADE AFTER THE CLOSING DATE.
