Assessment 1
1. I meet the Individual Occupational Requirements for the Hydrology series, 1315 because I have:

 A. Degree: physical or natural science, or engineering that included at least 30 semester hours in any combination of courses in hydrology, the physical sciences, geophysics, chemistry, engineering science, soils, mathematics, aquatic biology, atmospheric science, meteorology, geology, oceanography, or the management or conservation of water resources. The course work must have included at least 6 semester hours in calculus (including both differential and integral calculus), and at least 6 semester hours in physics. Calculus and physics, as described above, are requirements for all grade levels.
 B. Combination of education and experience-- course work as shown in A above, plus appropriate experience or additional education.
 C. I do not meet the Individual Occupational Requirement for the Hydrology series, 1315.
2. In addition to meeting the Individual Occupational Requirements, select the statement that best describes your experience performing the work of a Hydrologist, GS-1315-12 or equivalent grade level in the Federal service.

 A. I have at least one full year (52 weeks) of specialized experience equivalent to the next lower grade level (GS-11) in the Federal service which includes all of the following: Utilizing models, techniques and procedures for hydro-meteorological forecasts; and Representing an organization to stakeholders regarding hydrologic forecast and warning operations.
 B. I do not possess the experience described above.
3. In addition to meeting the Individual Occupational Requirements, select the statement that best describes your experience performing the work of a Hydrologist, GS-1315-13 or equivalent grade level in the Federal service.

 A. I have at least one full year (52 weeks) of specialized experience equivalent to the next lower grade level (GS-12) in the Federal service which includes all of the following: Maintaining and updating hydro-meteorological models, techniques and procedures for hydrologic forecasts; Analyzing hydrologic forecast and warning processes, procedures, and services to recommend operational improvement; and Representing an organization to internal and external stakeholders regarding hydrologic forecast and warning operations.
 B. I do not possess the experience as described above.
Assessment 2
1. Water resource forecasts are used by decision makers to regulate the flow of water from controlled reservoirs.
 A. True

 A. True
 B. False
3. Hydrologic data assimilation is the process of using long-term historical datasets exclusively to set the initial parameters of a hydrologic model before it is run for a simulation.
 A. True
 B. False
4. Regular calibration of hydrologic forecast models is necessary to improve the accuracy of the model.
 A. True
 B. False
5. Directing or managing the collection of hydrologic data requires a plan that includes network, design, standardized field procedures, and quality control to ensure the data is accurate, reliable and useful.
 A. True

 A. True
 B. False
8. During a rapidly escalating hydrologic event requiring immediate public safety actions, a forecaster receives preliminary model output and anecdotal field reports suggesting a critical exceedance of forecast levels. Prioritizing effective communication and risk mitigation, advising external partners to disregard all agency forecasts and rely exclusively on their localized field observations due to evolving conditions is the best course of action.
 A. True
 B. False
9. Gathering feedback on forecasts and services is the sole responsibility of the office supervisor.
 A. True
