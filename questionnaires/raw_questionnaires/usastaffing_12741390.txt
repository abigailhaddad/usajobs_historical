DRTs that require a certification, may be reassigned, promoted up to and including the full performance (journeyman) level, or changed to lower grade within the occupation, but may not be promoted beyond the journey level or placed in supervisory or managerial positions.
DRTs that require a certification only at higher grade levels must meet the certification requirement before they can be promoted to those higher grade levels..
