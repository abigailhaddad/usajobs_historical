MINIMUM QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS: Select the ONE statement below that best describes your experience and/or education to meet the minimum requirements for this position. Please refer to the Qualifications and Duties sections of this announcement for detailed information.
1. For this Health Technician, GS-7 position:
 A. I have at least one (1) full year of specialized experience equivalent to the next lower grade level (GS-6) in the Federal Service that has given me the particular knowledge, skills and abilities required to successfully perform the duties of the Health Technician position. Specialized experience includes but not limited to: Knowledge with working in an inpatient hospital setting or outpatient surgery or clinical setting; ability to accept phone calls and elicit allograft and administrative information to be acted on; knowledge of various hospital settings and medical terminology to assist patients, their families, and clinical staff; ability to effectively communicate tissue information from vendors and hospital staff through the utilization of professional phone etiquette. NOTE: Experience must be fully documented on your resume and must include job title, duties, month and year start/end dates AND hours worked per week.
 B. I have one full year of graduate education above high school level in a major field of study which is directly related to the work of the position. [NOTE: One year of full-time graduate education is considered to be the number of credit hours that the school attended has determined to represent 1 year of full-time study. If that information cannot be obtained from the school, 18 semester hours should be considered as satisfying the 1 year of full-time study requirement. Part-time graduate education is creditable in accordance with its relationship to a year of full-time study at the school attended.]
 C. I have a combination of education and experience to qualify at the GS-07 level. To calculate, first identify the percentage of required education you have earned (when substituting, you cannot use the first 18 semester hours that you earned). Then identify the percentage of required experience you possess. Add the two percentages. The total percentage must equal at least 100 percent to qualify at the GS-07. For example, an applicant who has 64 semester hours of education above high school level (i.e. 50% of four years of education required) and 6 months of creditable specialized experience (i.e. 50% of the required experience) would equal 100% of the required experience for the position.
