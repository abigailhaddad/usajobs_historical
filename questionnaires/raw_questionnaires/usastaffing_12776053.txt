For this Health Technician, GS-0640-05 position, I have:

Examples of qualifying specialized experience include, but are not limited to: The incumbent will serve as a Health Technician responsible for performing advanced skill levels sufficient to diagnose common podiatric pathology and perform common podiatric procedures that require considerable training and experience to carry out such as skin and toenail debridement, wound debridement with risk stratification according to updated PACT policy, application and removal of strappings, casts, braces, therapy devices and compression wraps and resolution of recurring problems.

Two full academic years of study, or 60 semester hours, beyond the second year is equivalent to 1 year of specialized experience.

The total percentage must equal at least 100 percent to qualify an applicant for GS-5. The following is an example of how education and experience may be combined. This is an example only, and is not all-inclusive. The position to be filled is a Health Technician, GS-5.

The applicant meets 67 percent of the required experience and 33 percent of the required education (i.e., 20 semester hours in excess of the first 60 semester hours).
