2. Are you currently employed as a permanent competitive service employee in the Command/UIC listed in the 'This job is open to' section at the top of the job opportunity announcement?

If you are:
Your Notification of Personnel Action, Standard Form 50 will show the UIC number in block 41 (e.g., "UIC:XXXXX) AND
Your Notification of Personnel Action, Standard Form 50 will reflect career or career-conditional: Tenure 1 or 2 in box 24 AND
Your Notification of Personnel Action, Standard Form 50 must reflect your status in the competitive service: Position Occupied is 1 in box 34 (unless you are on a permanent VRA appointment then it will show a 2 in box 34).

If you answer yes to this question, you are required to submit a copy of your most recent SF-50 showing you are employed at this command in the competitive service AND the SF-50 reflecting the highest grade held if not reflected on your most recent SF-50. Failure to submit this documentation with your application will result in a rating of ineligible. If you are serving on an excepted service veterans recruitment appointment (VRA) you must ALSO submit an SF-50 showing your conversion or appointment to the excepted service VRA appointment (Authority code in block 5-C will be J8M).

PLEASE NOTE: For GS positions, to be considered for a promotion, you must provide SF-50(s) that shows that you have held the next lower GS grade for at least one year. SF-50s that have an effective date within the past year (e.g., General Adjustment SF-50 from this year or Within Rate/Grade Increases (WRI/WGI) SF-50 within a year) do not clearly show that you meet the one-year time-in-grade requirement. That means if you submit an SF-50 that is dated within the last year, you must submit another SF-50 that is dated more than one year ago to clearly demonstrate you meet the time-in-grade requirements.

If you are a DoD employee, you can obtain a copy of your SF- 50(s) from MyBiz. Failure to provide documentation that fully supports your claim will result in a rating of ineligible.
 A. Yes
 B. No
