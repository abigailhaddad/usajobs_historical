Thank you for your interest in a position with the Department of Justice (DOJ). Your response to this assessment questionnaire, in conjunction with other portions of your completed application, will be evaluated in making screening decisions. This is a DOJ job application system. Your responses in this Assessment Questionnaire are subject to evaluation and verification. Later steps in the selection process are specifically designed to verify your responses. Deliberate attempts to falsify information will be grounds for disqualifying you or for dismissing you from employment following acceptance. Please review your responses for accuracy before you submit this application. Incomplete/incorrect responses may result in you not receiving appropriate consideration.
For the following questions, please select the response that best describes your education and/or experience. You may select only one response for each question. If you feel that your education or experience exceeds all of the descriptions for a particular question, choose the description that is the closest level to the experience or education that you possess. Failure to respond to these questions will result in an ineligible rating.
1. From the descriptions below, select the ONE response that BEST describes the specialized experience that demonstrates your ability to perform as a GS-7 Legal Administrative Specialist.

 A. I have at least one year of full-time specialized experience equivalent to the GS-5 level in Federal service. My qualifying experience involved performing routine litigation support assignments such as assisting with organizing case information, including creating grand jury logs and organizing grand jury responses; preparing discovery productions, including scanning and coding documents and creating CDs; assisting attorneys in preparing for court such as preparing exhibits, compiling trial notebooks, compiling witness and exhibit lists; verifying citations; and preparing a variety of legal documents; assisting in the use of technology to organize digital evidence; and editing a variety of legal documents, such as information requests, subpoenas, correspondence and memos.
 B. I have one full year of graduate level education in a closely related field (e.g., Information Technology, Computer Science, Law, Criminal Justice).
 C. I have successfully completed all the requirements for a bachelor?s degree in a closely related field (e.g., Information Technology, Computer Science, Law, Criminal Justice) ); or expect to complete within 9 months AND meet one of the following Superior Academic Achievement provisions: (1) class standing in the upper one-third of the graduating class; (2) a grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 or higher as recorded on the official transcript, or computed based on courses completed during the final two full years of the curriculum; (3) a GPA of 3.5 or higher based on the required courses completed in the major field or the required courses in a major field completed during the final two years of curriculum; or (4) election to a membership in a national scholastic honor society.
 D. I have the specialized experience as described in A, but less than one year; and I have some graduate education as described in B, but less than the required one year. I have computed the percentage of the requirements that I meet, and the total is at least 100% (To compute the percentage, divide your total months of qualifying experience by 12. Then, divide your semester hours of graduate education by 18. Add the two percentages. The total percentage must equal at least 100 percent to qualify).
 E. My experience and/or education is not reflected in any of the above statements.
2. Identify the specific experience from your resume or cover letter that validates your response. Also list the name and contact information of someone who can verify your response.

3. From the descriptions below, select the ONE response that BEST describes the specialized experience that demonstrates your ability to perform as a GS-9 Legal Administrative Specialist.

 A. I have at least one year of full-time specialized experience equivalent to the GS-7 level in Federal service. My qualifying experience involved assisting attorneys and legal support personnel with court rules, regulations and procedures, analyzing and evaluating legal decisions and case files to identify relevant issues and potential evidence; recommending automated support methods for trials; customizing databases and programs for user needs; assisting with trial preparation and presentations, and assisting attorneys with automatic evidence presentation in court; preparing motions, orders, pleadings, subpoenas and legal briefs, summaries of analyses and decisions, and pre-trial documents.
 B. I have one of the following types of education in a related field (e.g., Information Technology, Computer Science, Law, Criminal Justice): a Master's or equivalent graduate degree (such as an LL.B. or J.D.); OR 2 full years of progressively higher-level graduate education leading to such a degree. Education at the graduate level must be in an accredited college or university and must demonstrate the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to perform the duties of the position.
 C. I have a combination of specialized experience as described in A and graduate-level education as described in B which when combined equal 100% of the requirements. To calculate your percentage of graduate education, first determine the total number of graduate hours that exceed 18 semester hours (or your school's definition of one year of graduate study), then divide the total number of your excess graduate semester hours by 18 (or your school's definition of one year of graduate study). To calculate your percentage of qualifying experience, divide your total number of months of qualifying experience by 12. Now, add the two percentages together. The sum of the percentages must equal at least 100%. (Only graduate education in excess of the first full year may be used in this calculation.)
 D. My experience and/or education is not reflected in any of the above statements.
