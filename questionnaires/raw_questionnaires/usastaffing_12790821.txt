Under the VOW Act, tentative preference will be granted to a active duty service member who meets the following:Submit a certification (in lieu of a DD-214 form) along with their job application materials. (Agencies will verify the individual meets the definition of 'preference eligible' under 5.U.S.C. 2108 prior to appointment).
