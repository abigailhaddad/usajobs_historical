Assessment 1
Respond to all statements and questions. These statements and questions allow applicants to highlight their Knowledge, Skills and Abilities (KSAs) which are applicable to the position for which you are applying. If it is necessary to limit the number of applicants for a position, these KSAs will be used to determine the "Best Qualified".  For each KSA please identify below in the space provided how you have either demonstrated the KSA or have shown the potential to acquire them. Give specific examples describing related project, details, work assignments, outside activities, and the time frames involved in each. If you do not answer these statements and questions an accurate evaluation of your qualifications may not be possible. This may result in your application not being certified.

1. Skill to perform scheduled and unscheduled maintenance on one or more multi-complex electronic integrated systems.

2. Ability to review and analyze maintenance data; determines if criteria are sufficient to provide adequate test, troubleshooting and repair procedures; devises and recommends tests, procedural changes, or data corrections.

3. Ability to troubleshoot operational malfunctions and analyzes system performance utilizing aircrew debrief data, Technical Orders, schematic and wiring diagrams, engineering drawings, data analysis, common and system-specific test equipment and built in system tests.

4. A working knowledge of programming principles sufficient to analyze aircraft avionics equipment or Pods as well as computerized test stations software and software problems and to work with engineering personnel to correct them.

5. Extensive practical knowledge of hydraulic and pneumatic principles as well as pressurization.
Select “Yes” or “No” to the following question(s).
