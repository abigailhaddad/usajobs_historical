5. WG-2610-12:   Must have at least the AFSC 2A334, with 12+ months of work experience or training demonstrating the ability to repair, align, and adjust major integrated electronic systems such as inertial navigation system, automatic flight control, or fire control system. Extensive knowledge of electronic, pneumatic, hydraulic, and mechanical systems in order to understand and predict the progressive effects of malfunctions throughout the interrelated units, (e.g., trace an apparent operating error in the hydraulic controls of a gun mount back to the failure of a tactical computer to integrate yaw, pitch, azimuth, and velocity inputs) and to predict areas of technical difficulty in order to assist lower grade employees. Through knowledge of the application of electronic theories and practices to one or more complex integrated systems such as fire control, inertial navigation, or automatic landing control systems. Broad knowledge of such applications as radar, digital or analog computers, digital or cathode ray tube display devices, etc., and specific knowledge of the technology and practices which integrate these components into a total functional system. Knowledge of mathematics including algebra and basic trigonometric functions in order to adapt standard formulas to the specific requirements of the integrated system. Ability to follow drawings for integrated electronic systems such as radar navigation systems which integrate terrain information from the radar, pitch, roll, and turn rate, etc. from sensing devices and actuate control relays. Ability to trace the effect of a change in one subsystem to other integrated subsystems and determine which controls and devices must be changed or adjusted to compensate. Ability to diagnose and determine needed repairs for malfunctions in electronics systems such as weapons control where knowledge of the entire system is necessary to interpret error data and trace back through a number of units of the system to locate the deficiency.

Do you meet the above qualification standard?
 A. Yes
 B. No
Assessment 1
Respond to all statements and questions. These statements and questions allow applicants to highlight their Knowledge, Skills and Abilities (KSAs) which are applicable to the position for which you are applying. If it is necessary to limit the number of applicants for a position, these KSAs will be used to determine the "Best Qualified".  For each KSA please identify below in the space provided how you have either demonstrated the KSA or have shown the potential to acquire them. Give specific examples describing related project, details, work assignments, outside activities, and the time frames involved in each. If you do not answer these statements and questions an accurate evaluation of your qualifications may not be possible. This may result in your application not being certified.

1. Skill to perform scheduled and unscheduled maintenance on one or more multi-complex electronic integrated systems.
2. Ability to review and analyze maintenance data; determines if criteria are sufficient to provide adequate test, troubleshooting and repair procedures; devises and recommends tests, procedural changes, or data corrections.
3. Ability to troubleshoot operational malfunctions and analyzes system performance utilizing aircrew debrief data, Technical Orders, schematic and wiring diagrams, engineering drawings, data analysis, common and system-specific test equipment and built in system tests.
4. Working knowledge of the interaction of the avionics package on the aircraft.
5. Extensive practical knowledge of hydraulic and pneumatic principles as well as pressurization.
Select “Yes” or “No” to the following question(s).
