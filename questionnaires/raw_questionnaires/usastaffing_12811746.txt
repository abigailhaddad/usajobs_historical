Assessment 1
The following questions will be used to determine your eligibility for placement consideration. Please select the most appropriate answer to each of the following questions based on your current situation.


BASIC REQUIREMENTS. The basic requirements for employment as a VHA psychologist are prescribed by Public Law 96-151 codified in 38 U.S.C. § 7402. To qualify for appointment, all applicants for the position of psychologist in VHA must meet the following:


1.
Education

1.  Have a doctoral degree in psychology from a graduate program in psychology accredited by the American Psychological Association (APA), the Psychological Clinical Science Accreditation System (PCSAS), or the Canadian Psychological Association (CPA) at the time the program was completed. The specialty area of the degree must be consistent with the assignment for which the applicant is to be employed. For the purpose of meeting this requirement, the term "specialty area" refers to the specific specialty areas recognized by the accrediting body and not to specific job duties that might require special skills. Currently, APA accredits doctoral programs in the specialty areas of clinical psychology, counseling psychology, school psychology, or combinations of two or more of those areas. PCSAS accredits doctoral programs in psychological clinical science. CPA accredits doctoral programs in clinical psychology, counseling psychology, clinical neuropsychology, and school psychology. There are no job assignments in VHA that require the skills of a school psychologist; therefore, an applicant with a degree in the specialty area of school psychology is not eligible for appointment. Strictly for the purpose of determining eligibility for appointment as a psychologist in VHA, there is no distinction between the specialty areas (with the exception of school psychology).

OR
   
 2. Have a doctoral degree in any area of psychology and, in addition, successfully complete a re- specialization program (including documentation of an approved internship completed as part of the re- specialization program) meeting both of the following conditions:
       a. The re-specialization program must be completed in an APA or a CPA accredited doctoral program; and,
       b. the specialty in which the applicant is retrained must be consistent with the assignment for which the applicant is to be         
           employed.

NOTE: The applicant must provide an official transcript and/or certificate documenting the completion of the re-specialization program, which includes completion of an APA or CPA internship. [Psychologists who have successfully completed a re-specialization program as described above and who were employed by the Department of Veterans Affairs prior to the implementation of this standard are considered to have fully met the educational requirements of these qualification standards.]

OR

3. Have a doctoral degree awarded between 1951 and 1978 from a regionally-accredited institution, with a dissertation primarily psychological in nature.]

AND

4. Internships
      a. Have successfully completed a professional psychology internship training program that was accredited by APA or CPA at the
          time the program was completed and that is consistent with the assignment for which the applicant is to be employed.

OR

     b. New VHA psychology internship programs that are in the process of applying for APA accreditation are acceptable in fulfillment
         of the internship requirement, provided that such programs were sanctioned by the VHA Central Office Program Director for
         Psychology and the VHA Office of Academic Affiliations at the time that the individual was an intern;

OR

     c. VHA facilities that offered full-time, one-year pre-doctoral internships prior to PL 96- 151 (pre- 1979) are considered to be
         acceptable in fulfillment of the internship requirement;

OR

     d. Applicants who completed an internship that was not accredited by APA or CPA at the time the program was completed may be 
         considered eligible for hire only if they are currently board certified by the American Board of Professional Psychology in a
         specialty area that is consistent with the assignment for which the applicant is to be employed. (NOTE: Once board certified,
         the employee is required to maintain board certification.)

OR
    
     e. Applicants who have a doctoral degree awarded between 1951 and 1978 from a regionally- accredited institution with a
        dissertation primarily psychological in nature may fulfill this internship requirement by having the equivalent of a one-year
        supervised internship experience in a site specifically acceptable to the candidate's doctoral program. If the internship
        experience is not noted on the applicant's official transcript, the applicant must provide a statement from the doctoral program
        verifying that the equivalent of a one-year supervised internship experience was completed in a site acceptable to the doctoral
        program.

NOTE: Psychologists who meet the requirements of this revision and who were employed by the Department of Veterans Affairs prior to the implementation of this standard are considered to have fully met the requirements of this qualification standard.]

Do you meet this Basic Educational Requirement?
Please note: Transcripts that show applicant name, school attended, degree earned and date conferred must be provided. Failure to include transcripts will result in being rated as ineligible for further consideration.
 Yes. I meet one of the educational requirements listed above and uploaded my diploma and/or transcripts.
 No. My education is not listed above.


2.

Hold a full, current, and unrestricted license to practice psychology at the doctoral level in a State, Territory, or Commonwealth of the United States, or the District of Columbia.
Exception. Non-licensed applicants who otherwise meet the eligibility requirements may be given a temporary appointment as a "graduate psychologist" at the GS-11 or GS-12 grade under the authority of 38 U.S.C. § 7405 [(c)(2)(B)] for a period not to exceed two years from the date of employment on the condition that such a psychologist provide care only under the supervision of a psychologist who is licensed. Failure to obtain licensure during that period is justification for termination of the temporary appointment.

 Yes, I meet the Licensure requirement and have included documentation to demonstrate I meet this requirement with my application.

Board Certification. Persons hired to psychology positions in the VHA who completed an internship that was not accredited at the time the program was completed must be board certified by the American Board of Professional Psychology in a specialty area that is consistent with the assignment for which the applicant is to be employed.

A psychologist who fails to maintain the required board certification must be removed from the occupation, which may result in termination of employment. At the discretion of the appointing official, an employee may be reassigned to another occupation if qualified and if a placement opportunity exists.
