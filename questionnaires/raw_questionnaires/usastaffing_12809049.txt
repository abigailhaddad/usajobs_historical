 Manually monitoring each shipment’s progress on a map and triggering alerts based on visual inspection.
 Defining static rules based on predefined thresholds (e.g., “Alert if shipment is more than 2 hours behind schedule”).
 Implementing a machine learning model that learns the typical travel times and patterns for each route and flags any deviations that exceed a certain threshold.
 Averaging the travel times for all shipments on a given route and flagging any shipment that deviates from the average.


12.
You need to create a user-friendly interface within Foundry Workshop which allows logistics mangers to quickly identify shipments at risk of delay, drill down into the details of those shipments, and take corrective actions (e.g., re-routing vehicles, contacting customers).

 Using a simple table to display all shipments, with a filter to show only those with a delay prediction above a certain threshold.
 Creating a geospatial map with shipments color-coded by delay risk, along with interactive filters to narrow down the view, and Workshop Actions to trigger pre-defined corrective workflows.
 Generating a static PDF report with a list of delayed shipments and their details.
