Assessment 1
Thank you for your interest in a position with the Department of Justice (DOJ). Your response to this assessment questionnaire, in conjunction with other portions of your completed application, will be evaluated in making screening decisions. This is a DOJ job application system. Your responses in this Assessment Questionnaire are subject to evaluation and verification. Later steps in the selection process are specifically designed to verify your responses. Deliberate attempts to falsify information will be grounds for disqualifying you or for dismissing you from employment following acceptance. Please review your responses for accuracy before you submit this application. Incomplete/incorrect responses may result in you not receiving appropriate consideration.
For the following questions, please select the response that best describes your education and/or experience. You may select only one response for each question. If you feel that your education or experience exceeds all of the descriptions for a particular question, choose the description that is the closest level to the experience or education that you possess. Failure to respond to these questions will result in an ineligible rating.
1. From the descriptions below, select the ONE response that BEST describes the specialized experience that demonstrates your ability to perform as a GS-11 Victim-Witness Specialist.

 A. I have at least one full year of experience equivalent to the GS-09 level in Federal service. My qualifying is defined as experience advocating on behalf of crime victims; providing information to victims in regards to status of cases and results of trials; providing in court support during hearings; and obtaining services and assistance for victims; analyzing victim communication needs; developing and administering a comprehensive victim/witness program; conducting workshops or meetings with victim subject-matter specialists and related officials; and determining the elements of an effective victim assistance program.
 B. I have one of the following types of education in a related field (e.g., Criminal Justice, social work, Psychology, Sociology): a Ph.D. or equivalent doctorate degree; OR 3 full years of progressively higher-level graduate education leading to such a degree or LL.M, if related.
 C. I have a combination of specialized experience as described in A and graduate education as described in B which when combined equal 100% of the requirements. To calculate your percentage of graduate education, first determine the total number of graduate hours that exceed 36 semester hours (or your school?s definition of two years of graduate study), then divide the total number of your excess graduate semester hours by 18 (or your school?s definition of one year of graduate study). To calculate your percentage of qualifying experience, divide your total number of months of qualifying experience by 12. Now add the two percentage together. The sum of the percentages must equal at least 100%. (Only graduate education in excess of the first two (2) years may be used in this calculation.)
 D. I do not have the experience or education described above.
2. From the descriptions below, select the ONE response that BEST describes the specialized experience that demonstrates your ability to perform as a GS-12 Victim-Witness Specialist.

I understand that any information I give may be investigated. I understand that responding "No" to this item will result in my not being considered for this position.

I understand a comprehensive background investigation, including a check of my credit history and a pre-employment drug screening, is required for this position.
