Assessment 1
Thank you for your interest in the Electronics Engineer position with the Defense Microelectronics Activity. Your resume and the responses you provide to this assessment questionnaire will be used to determine if you are among the best qualified for this position. Your responses are subject to verification. Please review your responses for accuracy before you submit your application.


1.
From the descriptions below, select the letter that BEST describes the highest level of experience that you fully possess in order to minimally qualify for the position of Electronics Engineer, NH-0855-03. Read all the statements completely before making your selection.
 I possess one year of specialized experience at the NH-02 or GS-11 equivalent or equivalent under other pay systems in the Federal service, military or private sector. My creditable specialized experience includes: FPGA Development using VHDL and/or Verilog design tools to perform Synthesis and Simulation. Evaluating Electronics designs and products using analysis equipment like Power Analyzers, Signal Analyzers, Network Analyzers, Oscilloscopes, and/or GPS Simulators. Using advanced microelectronics CAD software like Altium, Cadence, or OrCad to design microcircuits, layout PCBs, and simulate system functionality. Simulating, validating, and/or testing Radio Frequency (RF) electronics and RF Antennas using Anechoic Chambers, CST Studio (or equivalent), Antenna Magus (or equivalent), and/or ADS Software.
 I do not possess the required level of specialized experience to qualify for this position.


2.
The purpose of this question is to verify that you meet the Individual Occupational Requirements for this position. Please select the answer that best describes your situation. All education must have been received from an accredited college or university. FAILURE TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION WILL MAKE YOU INELIGIBLE.
 Degree: Engineering. To be acceptable, the program must: (1) lead to a bachelorâ€™s degree in a school of engineering with at least one program accredited by ABET; or (2) include differential and integral calculus and courses (more advanced than first-year physics and chemistry) in five of the following seven areas of engineering science or physics: (a) statics, dynamics; (b) strength of materials (stress-strain relationships); (c) fluid mechanics, hydraulics; (d) thermodynamics; (e) electrical fields and circuits; (f) nature and properties of materials (relating particle and aggregate structure to properties); and (g) any other comparable area of fundamental engineering science or physics, such as optics, heat transfer, soil mechanics, or electronics.
 Combination of education and experience -- college-level education, training, and/or technical experience that furnished (1) a thorough knowledge of the physical and mathematical sciences underlying engineering, and (2) a good understanding, both theoretical and practical, of the engineering sciences and techniques and their applications to one of the branches of engineering. The adequacy of such background must be demonstrated by one of the following: 1. Professional registration or licensure -- Current registration as an Engineer Intern (EI), Engineer in Training (EIT)1, or licensure as a Professional Engineer (PE) by any State, the District of Columbia, Guam, or Puerto Rico. Absent other means of qualifying under this standard, those applicants who achieved such registration by means other than written test (e.g., State grandfather or eminence provisions) are eligible only for positions that are within or closely related to the specialty field of their registration. For example, an applicant who attains registration through a State Board's eminence provision as a manufacturing engineer typically would be rated eligible only for manufacturing engineering positions. 2. Written Test -- Evidence of having successfully passed the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE)2 examination or any other written test required for professional registration by an engineering licensure board in the various States, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico. 3. Specified academic courses -- Successful completion of at least 60 semester hours of courses in the physical, mathematical, and engineering sciences and that included the courses specified in the basic requirements under paragraph A. The courses must be fully acceptable toward meeting the requirements of an engineering program as described in paragraph A. 4. Related curriculum -- Successful completion of a curriculum leading to a bachelor's degree in an appropriate scientific field, e.g., engineering technology, physics, chemistry, architecture, computer science, mathematics, hydrology, or geology, may be accepted in lieu of a bachelorâ€™s degree in engineering, provided the applicant has had at least 1 year of professional engineering experience acquired under professional engineering supervision and guidance. Ordinarily there should be either an established plan of intensive training to develop professional engineering competence, or several years of prior professional engineering-type experience, e.g., in interdisciplinary positions. (The above examples of related curricula are not all inclusive.)
 I do not possess the education or experience required to meet the Individual Occupational Requirements for this position.
