This is a DOJ job application system. Your responses in this Assessment Questionnaire are subject to evaluation and verification. Later steps in the selection process are specifically designed to verify your responses. Deliberate attempts to falsify information will be grounds for disqualifying you or for dismissing you from employment following acceptance. Please review your responses for accuracy before you submit this application. Incomplete/incorrect responses may result in you not receiving appropriate consideration.
For each of the following questions, please select the response that best describes your education and/or experience. You may select only one response for each question. If you feel that your education or experience exceeds all of the descriptions for a particular question, choose the description that is the closest level to the experience or education that you possess. Failure to respond to these questions will result in an ineligible rating.
1. From the descriptions below, select the ONE response that BEST describes the education and/or experience that you possess that demonstrates your ability to perform as a GS-950-09, Paralegal Specialist:

 A. I have at least one full year of specialized experience equivalent to the GS-07 level in Federal service. My qualifying experience included the following: experience performing research, evaluation and analysis of a variety of routine legal topics, researching references to locate appropriate data using multiple online legal systems, organizing and preparing research material and determining information that is pertinent to the case, performing basic legal analysis, and analyzing information, identifying missing information that requires additional research or investigation and identifying the appropriate reference sources. Ideal candidates will have experience in Financial Litigation, bankruptcy, commercial, creditors' rights, tax, or real property litigation.
 B. I possess a Master’s or equivalent degree in a related field (e.g. Criminal Justice, Law, etc.) or, two full years of progressively higher level graduate education leading to such a degree, or an LLB or J.D. in a related field (e.g. Criminal Justice, Law, etc.)
 C. I have a combination of specialized experience as described in A and education as described in B which when combined equal 100% of the requirements. (To calculate your percentage of education, divide the total number of your graduate semester hours by 18 or your school's definition of one year of study. To calculate your percentage of qualifying experience, divide your total number of months of qualifying experience by 12. Now, add the two percentages together. The sum of the percentages must equal at least 100%. For example, if you had 9 months of specialized experience equivalent to the GS-07, then you would have 75% of the required experience. If you also had 9 semester hours of creditable graduate level education, then 9 divided by 18 is 50% of the required education, and therefore, 75% + 50% = 125%. You would qualify for this position).
 D. I do not have the education or experience as described above.
2. List the specific position/dates from your resume or cover letter that validates your response. Also list the name and contact information of someone who can verify your response.

 B. I possess a Ph.D. or equivalent doctoral degree in a related field (e.g., Criminal Justice, Law, etc.), or three full years of progressively higher level graduate education leading to such a degree, or LLM in a related field (e.g., Criminal Justice, Law, etc.).
 C. I have a combination of specialized experience as described in A and graduate-level education as described in B which when combined equal 100% of the requirements. To calculate your percentage of graduate education, first determine the total number of graduate hours that exceed 18 semester hours (or your school's definition of one year of graduate study), then divide the total number of your excess graduate semester hours by 18 (or your school's definition of one year of graduate study). To calculate your percentage of qualifying experience, divide your total number of months of qualifying experience by 12. Now, add the two percentages together. The sum of the percentages must equal at least 100%. (Only graduate education in excess of the first full year may be used in this calculation.)
