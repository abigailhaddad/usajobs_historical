Assessment 1
Transcript Reminder - If you are basing your qualifications on education (or a combination of education and experience) or if the position requires a college education to qualify, you must submit a copy of your transcripts with your application. Your official or unofficial transcript must reflect: name of the college or university, full address of the college or university, your name, class title(s) with the number of credits earned/completed, the degree received, if applicable, and date degree conferred. A copy of your certificate/degree or screenshot of your current classes are not acceptable, are not a replacement of your transcript, and they will not be used in the qualifying process.

SF-50(s) Reminder - If you are a current, permanent General Schedule (GS) Federal employee, your most recent SF-50, dated in the current calendar year, 1/1/2024 or after, must be submitted with your application to be used for qualification.

If you are a current, permanent General Schedule (GS) Federal employee, your most recent SF-50 may not provide proof of one year at the next lower grade level (Time-in-Grade (TIG)).

In this instance, you must provide additional SF-50(s) that clearly demonstrates one-year at that grade level (TIG); award SF-50s cannot be used for TIG as it does not contain enough information. In many cases, we need to see additional SF-50s to determine time-in-grade and eligibility for promotion.
