GRADUATE HEALTHCARE ADMINISTRATIVE TRAINING PROGRAM (GHATP) STATEMENT OF UNDERSTANDING: I understand the purpose of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Graduate Healthcare Administrative Training Program (GHATP) is to develop qualified employees who possess the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities to provide effective staff support to key health care management officials as well as lead the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) healthcare delivery system into the 21st century. Accordingly, I understand I may be assigned to another VA facility after successful completion of the training period which will be made in the Department's interest; and that, while my preferences will be considered when administratively feasible, I will be expected to accept assignment at any VA facility in the continental United States where my services are needed.

I further understand that this training program is an integral part of a management development system designed to provide, through the progressive development of career employees, for the ongoing replenishment of qualified personnel in key administrative and management positions in the VHA. Accordingly, I understand that upon successful completion of training, I will be expected, with supervisory assistance, to plan and execute self-development activities progressively throughout my career. Should the supervisor/mentor of my training determine at any time that I am failing to meet the objectives of the program, I will be advised in writing of the specific deficiencies in my performance, and given a 60 calendar day improvement period.

Should I select a position in a different commuting area, I understand that no guarantee will be made for payment of my relocation expenses.

If I enter the program through voluntary change to lower grade, I understand that re-promotion to my former grade is neither guaranteed nor implied.
