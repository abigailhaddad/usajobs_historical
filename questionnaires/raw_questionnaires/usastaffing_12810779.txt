From the descriptions below, select the appropriate response based on your level of experience, education, and/or training, that you fully possess and that demonstrates your ability to perform Electrical Equipment Repairer duties without more than normal supervision.
 I have the ability to perform the most difficult and complex tasks which include troubleshooting, repairing, overhauling, and testing a wide variety of complex electrical and electronic equipment and systems. I am considered an expert in identifying and correcting malfunctions in AC/DC convertors, inverters, power distribution panels, and automated control systems. I apply advanced knowledge of electrical and electronic theory, as well as mechanical, pneumatic and hydraulic principles, to isolate and repair faults at the component level. I use specialized diagnostics equipment such as oscilloscopes, frequency meters, and impedance bridges to verify system performance. I perform my duties with a high degree of independence and ensure repairs meet established technical standards and specifications.
 I have the ability to perform the full range duties which include installing, testing, troubleshooting, modifying, and repairing electrical and electronic systems and components. I am skilled in interpreting blueprints, schematics, and technical manuals to locate malfunctions and determine corrective actions. I regularly use test equipment such as voltmeters, ohmmeters, and oscilloscopes to diagnose issues in printed circuit boards, amplifiers, sensing units, and control systems. I work independently under general supervision, completing assignments that include rebuilding wire harnesses, replacing circuit components such as diodes, transistors, and capacitors, and conducting functional tests to verify operational reliability.
 I have the ability to perform common duties which include assisting in troubleshooting, repairing, and testing of electrical and electronic equipment under normal supervision. I follow established procedures to replace defective parts, perform continuity checks, and conduct basic functional tests. I work under the direction of a journey-level employee or work leader who reviews my work to ensure accuracy and proper completion. I am familiar with using standard electrical tools and test equipment and adhere to safety procedures and technical guidance while performing assigned tasks.
 I have the ability to perform simple electrical repair duties and have received training in basic tasks such as identifying components, connecting circuits, and performing minor repairs under close supervision.
