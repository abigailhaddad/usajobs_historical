Under the VOW Act, tentative preference will be granted to a active duty service member who meets the following:Submit a certification (in lieu of a DD-214 form) along with their job application materials. (Agencies will verify the individual meets the definition of 'preference eligible' under 5.U.S.C. 2108 prior to appointment).
A "certification" is any written document from the Armed Forces that certifies the service member is expected to be discharged or released from Active Duty service in the Armed Forces within 120 days after the certification is submitted by the applicant.
The certification letter should be on letterhead of the appropriate military branch of service and contain (1) the military service dates including the expected discharge or release date; and (2) the Character of Service.Note:  If the certification has expired; you must provide documentation (e.g., a copy of the DD form 214) that demonstrates the service member is a preference eligible per 5 U.S.C. 2108, in your application package before veterans' preference can be awarded.
