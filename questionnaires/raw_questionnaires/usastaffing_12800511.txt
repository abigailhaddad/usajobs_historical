GRADE DETERMINATIONS. In addition to the basic requirements for appointment, the following criteria must be used when determining the appropriate grade assignment of candidates
General Radiologic Technology (R). DRTs perform procedures and examinations in hospitals or clinics under the direction of radiologists and other medical officers. The objective of the examinations and procedures is to produce radiographic studies that are used in medical diagnosis and interpreted by medical officers to locate injuries, foreign bodies, pathological conditions, or lesions within the body. They prepare and administer contrast media and medications in accordance with State and Federal regulations. All DRTs must be knowledgeable in computerized [and digital radiography (CR/DR),] and picture archiving and communications systems (PACS).

Assignment. DRTs at this level operate and monitor commonly used equipment performing routine procedures under general supervision. The technician functions somewhat independently in carrying out these standardized procedures of limited complexity. Deviations from regular procedures, unanticipated problems, and unfamiliar situations are referred to the supervisor for a decision or help. Some assignments at this level also include developmental duties involving more complex procedures designed to prepare the technician for promotion to higher grades in a functional area. Such duties are performed under closer supervision.
