What should I include in my resume?

Whether you're a current federal employee or new to the federal government, your resume is the primary way for you to communicate your education, skills and experience. The federal government does not have a standard job application. Your resume is your application.

A resume for a federal job is different than one for the private sector.
You must address each of the requirements and qualifications listed in the announcement-write clearly and without jargon. The hiring agency will not make assumptions about what's in your resume.
It requires more detailed descriptions of your work experiences, including experience level and complexity of work and may exceed the private sectors commonly recommended one to two pages.
You must include the start and end dates (month/year) and number of hours worked per week for each work experience.
You should tailor your resume for each federal job you apply for instead of using the same resume.


Before you write your resume. Read the entire job announcement. Focus on the following sections to understand whether you qualify for the position. This critical information is found under:???????
Duties
Requirements, which lists the Qualifications, and Specialized Experience and Education
How to Apply which will include a link to a preview of an assessment questionnaire, if that is required
How You Will be Evaluated



Make sure you have the required experience and education before you apply. Hiring agencies use the job announcement to describe the job and the required qualifications, including:

Level and amount of experience
Education
Training



What to include in your resume


Federal jobs often require that you have experience in a particular type of work for a certain amount of time. Your resume must show how your skills and experiences meet the qualifications and requirements listed in the job announcement to be considered for the job.

Include important contact information at the top
Full name
Your address
Your email address
Your phone number


Read the job opportunity carefully to make sure you have included all required contact information.


Include dates, number of hours worked per week, level of experience and examples for each work experience
 

For each work experience, make sure you include:

Job title
Start and end dates (including the month and year).
The number of hours you worked per week.
The level of experience-describe the level of responsibility you had, for instance, whether you served as a project manager or a team member helps to illustrate your level of experience.
The amount of experience-use numbers to illustrate the number of people you managed, or the number of years you worked or managed.
Examples of relevant experience and accomplishments. Write your experience by matching your work experiences and accomplishments with language in the job announcement. Your experience needs to address every required qualification and prove that you can perform the tasks at the level required as stated in the job announcement.
