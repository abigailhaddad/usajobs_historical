This exam is used to assess an applicant's potential to successfully perform the duties of an entry-level Contact Representative. The items in this exam were developed to evaluate the competencies needed to successfully perform well on the job as a Contact Representative.
This assessment is entirely computer-based. The exam items begin on the next page. Use scrap paper and calculators at your discretion. There is no penalty for guessing. This exam contains two types of items. There are 24 judgment items that will present you with a situation and ask you to choose which of the response options would be your most likely response to that situation. Select the option that would be your "Most Likely" response to the situation in the appropriate column. You should respond to each scenario based ONLY on the information provided in that scenario. While some scenarios may appear similar in nature, you should consider each scenario independently.
These items evaluate an applicant's judgment in critical situations that entry-level Contact Representatives may encounter on the job. While these questions represent situations that are similar to those that occur on the job, knowledge of the job is NOT required to respond.
However, you should keep in mind that the major duties of a Contact Representative include answering telephone calls from individual or business taxpayers on a hotline, as well as answering written inquiries from taxpayers. Each call or written message is a case that a Contact Representative is responsible for resolving. It is important to fully and accurately resolve as many cases as possible, avoiding additional action needed by the taxpayer or other IRS employees, where possible (e.g., avoid taxpayers having to call back; avoid taxpayers needing to take action after the call; avoid transferring the call to other IRS employees when you can resolve it). It is also important to close cases quickly to get to as many calls or messages as possible each day. Contact Representatives also have reading time allocated each week to review and research materials in order to stay current on the latest relevant information.
In addition to the judgment items, there are 8 multiple choice items that will present you with a question followed by three (3) or four (4) response options (A, B, C, etc.). Carefully read the question and all of the response options provided and select the one best answer for each item. Some questions refer to written passages presented above the question.  Although all items measure competencies relevant to the Contact Representative job, the item and/or passage content does not always reflect actual Contact Representative job circumstances.

5. You receive a call from a taxpayer who currently has a payment plan with the IRS. The taxpayer would like to know the amount to pay off his balance in full. You know that payoff amounts are impacted by recent payments, the date of the payoff payment, and the method of payment (e.g., electronic vs. mailed check). When looking into his account, you see his payoff figure listed as of today.

Given this situation, what would you most likely do?


 A. Provide the taxpayer with the payoff figure based on the payments received and thank him for his call.
 B. Direct the taxpayer to his online account where he can look up his payoff amount.
 C. Ask the taxpayer when and how he made his last payment and if he plans to pay off the balance today.
 D. Instruct the taxpayer that the next payment reminder will include the information he needs.
 E. None of the above
6. You receive a call from a taxpayer who is being charged a penalty for a late tax return. The taxpayer does not understand why she is being penalized since she filed for an extension to the due date. As you review the taxpayer's account, you see the tax return was filed late, but there is no request for an extension on file.

Given this situation, what would you most likely do?

 A. Advise the taxpayer on the time frames for filing an extension.
 B. Ask the taxpayer for more details on when and how she filed for an extension.
 C. Place the taxpayer on hold and discuss the case with your manager.
 D. Research the guidelines to see what can be done to assist the taxpayer.
 E. None of the above
7. You have recently been reminded by your manager to resolve calls more efficiently. Later that day, a customer calls to obtain the taxable income value from her elderly mother's most recent tax return for her assisted living facility intake form. You check the mother's account, and see the customer is not authorized to receive information about the account but can see the taxable income amount she is requesting. You explain to the customer that because she is not authorized, her mother will need to make the request, but she explains that she needs the information right away. There are multiple methods by which the request can be made and the information can be received by the customer.

Given this situation, what would you most likely do?
 A. Direct the customer to the IRS website which provides self-help guidance.
 B. Ask the customer if she has any additional questions.
 C. Provide the taxable income value given the time sensitivity of the matter.
 D. Explain all methods of making the request to receive the information.
 E. None of the above
8. You are supporting a taxpayer in the middle of a very busy day. The taxpayer wants to know what actions she can take to appeal a lien that has been filed against her past due taxes. In an effort to help the taxpayer, you navigate to electronic guidance on appealing liens. You select a hyperlink directing you to important information that will answer her question, but you notice that the hyperlink directs you to a broken webpage. You know that the information is available without using the hyperlink, so you research manually to find the information you need to help the taxpayer. As you find the information, you notice that you have been on the call for several minutes longer than average.

Given this situation, what would you most likely do?
 A. Explain the appeals process to the taxpayer and mentally note the broken link so you can manually look up that information in the future.
 B. Politely put the taxpayer on hold and report the broken link to management.
 C. Explain the appeals process to the taxpayer and report the broken link to management following the call.
 D. Provide the taxpayer with the needed appeals process information and move on to support the next caller.

9. You receive a call from a taxpayer who has concerns with her account. The taxpayer has been explaining her concerns for over five minutes. As she is talking, you notice that your lunch break was supposed to begin two minutes ago. In your department, there are strict guidelines on taking lunch breaks during the allotted times. These guidelines are in place to ensure that the taxpayer hotlines are staffed appropriately.

Given this situation, what would you most likely do?

 A. Wrap up the call quickly and update the account information after you return from your lunch break.
 B. Complete the call, conducting all of the necessary research and updates to the account.
 C. Email your manager to notify her that you are running over on a call and ask her what you should do.
 D. Adjourn the call and ask the taxpayer if you can call her back following your lunch break.
 E. None of the above
10. Your team has just been told that they are falling behind on the number of cases they resolve, and they need to try to increase their numbers. After you and your team return to your desks, you receive a written request from a taxpayer. The request is not clear to you and does not appear to provide you with all of the information you need. You could send the taxpayer a letter letting him know additional information is needed, which would enable you to close the contact quickly, but will require the taxpayer to contact the IRS again. You could call the taxpayer, but that would take additional time. Or, you could make some assumptions about what the taxpayer is requesting; however, if you are incorrect, interest could be assessed on the account.

Given this situation, what would you most likely do?

 A. Call the taxpayer to get the additional information that is needed to address his request.
 B. Send the letter to the taxpayer to tell him more information is needed.
 C. Send the case to your manager to see which action she recommends that you take.
 D. Make an assumption about what the taxpayer requested and complete his request.
 E. None of the above
11. You are helping a taxpayer who is facing financial hardship and has received an eviction notice. After reviewing the taxpayer's account, you notice that the taxpayer has not filed tax returns for several years. You continue reviewing the account and notice that based on the taxpayer's monthly income, the taxpayer is unable to pay the full amount owed. You think that the taxpayer may qualify to have delayed payments due to the financial hardship; however, you have never handled a taxpayer situation of this matter.

Given this situation, what would you most likely do?

 A. Transfer the call to your manager, telling her that you think the taxpayer qualifies for delayed payments.
 B. Before taking any action, confirm with your manager that you are making the right decision.
 C. Ask a coworker to confirm whether you are making the right decision, and then provide information to the taxpayer.
 D. Using your job aids, confirm that the taxpayer qualifies and walk the taxpayer through next steps.
 E. None of the above
12. You receive a call from a taxpayer who was recently laid off from his job and needs assistance negotiating a payment plan to pay taxes that are due. You think you remember from training how to identify the balance due and the steps required for taxpayers to update payment plans, but you are unsure of his next steps and responsibilities regarding the full amount that is due and a previously negotiated payment plan.

Given this situation, what would you most likely do?

 A. Perform research to verify the balance due calculation and identify next steps and responsibilities to provide to the taxpayer.
 B. Put the taxpayer on hold while you ask a coworker about how to initiate an update to a payment plan, and the next steps and responsibilities.
 C. Transfer the call to a coworker in your department that has been a Contact Representative longer than you and likely knows the answer.

 E. None of the above
13. You receive a call from a taxpayer requesting to set up a payment plan for his balance due on the current year's taxes. You review the taxpayer's account and see he qualifies for a payment plan. While researching job aids and reference materials, you find a reference that outlines the process to set up a payment plan. You have been trained on this process, but have never done it before.

Given this situation, what would you most likely do?

 A. Ask a coworker to walk through the steps to set up a payment plan with you.
 B. Transfer the call to another coworker who is familiar with the payment plan process.
 C. Set up the payment plan using the process found during your research.
 D. Request assistance from a technical lead to set up the payment plan for the taxpayer.

This is the first time in a while that a taxpayer has requested an account transcript, but you found the appropriate job aid to help with the request. While looking for the transcript, you realize the automated transcript system is not responding to your requests.

Given this situation, what would you most likely do?
 A. Submit a ticket with the IT department while having small talk with the taxpayer.
 B. Explain the technical issue, then direct him to the IRS website to access the transcript.
 C. Perform additional research to identify how to manually send the account transcript.
 D. Inform the taxpayer that you will submit the request when the system is working again.
 E. None of the above

The IRS has recently implemented a new tool to help Contact Representatives make updates to contact information in taxpayer accounts, but you find that the new tool is not recognizing address updates. You know the tool is used to update contact information across multiple IRS systems at once. The next call you receive is from a taxpayer wanting to change her address in her account.

Given this situation, what would you most likely do?

 A. Refer the taxpayer to the IRS website so she can make the address update.
 B. Research an alternate way to update the taxpayer’s address across all IRS systems.
 C. Inform the taxpayer to call back later then report the issue to your manager.
 D. Put the taxpayer on hold while you call IT to see if the tool can be fixed.

Given this situation, what would you most likely do?

 A. Apologize that you are unable to understand and refer the taxpayer to the IRS website.
 B. Tell the taxpayer to call back another time with a translator and disconnect the call.
 C. Transfer the call to a bilingual coworker who could better help the taxpayer.
 D. Ask the taxpayer if there is a person with him who speaks English and could translate.

17. You have just been trained on how to set up payment agreements.

Given this situation, what would you most likely do?

 A. Save the chart to a place on your computer where you can easily reference it.
 B. File the email with the attached chart in one of your email inbox folders.
 C. Use your desk calendar to calculate the first payment when needed.

Given this situation, what would you most likely do?

 A. Set the materials aside for now and wait to see if there is a need to refer to them when assisting taxpayers.
 B. Organize a coffee break with coworkers to discuss the challenges with the training materials.

File Form 8809 as soon as you know an extension of time to file is necessary. However, Form 8809 must be filed by the due date of the returns. Filers and transmitters of Form W-2 whose business has terminated should follow the procedures in the Instructions for Forms W-2 and W- 3 to request an extension.
If you are requesting an extension of time to file several types of forms, you may use one Form 8809, but you must file Form 8809 by the earliest due date. For example, if you are requesting an extension of time to file both Forms 1099 and 5498, you must file Form 8809 by February 28 (March 31 if you file electronically). You may complete more than one Form 8809 to avoid this problem. An extension cannot be granted if a request is filed after the due date of the original returns.
The automatic extension period is 30 days from the original due date. You may request one additional extension of not more than 30 days by submitting a second Form 8809 before the end of the first extension period. Requests for an additional extension of time to file information returns are not automatically granted. Generally, requests for additional time are granted only in cases of extreme hardship or catastrophic event. The IRS will send you a letter of explanation approving or denying your request for an additional extension.
Note. The automatic and any approved additional request will only extend the due date for filing the returns. It will not extend the due date for furnishing statements to recipients.
 
If you file required information returns late and you have not applied for and received an approved extension of time to file, you may be subject to a late filing penalty. The amount of the penalty is based on when you file the correct information return. For more information on penalties, see part O in the General Instructions for Certain Information Returns, and Penalties in the Instructions for Form 1042-S, the Instructions for Form 8027, and the Instructions for Forms W-2 and W-3.

32. Requests for an additional extension beyond the first extension are granted when:
 A. The request is for one additional extension of not more than 30 days.
 B. It is a case of extreme hardship or a catastrophic event.
 C. The second extension was received within 30 days from the first extension.
 D. None of the above
33. In which circumstance would you accrue a late filing penalty?
 A. When an extension request is filed with a Form 8809 by the due date of the return.
 B. When an extension is requested for a terminated business per the Instructions for Forms W-2 and W-3.
 C. When the tax return is filed late and an approved extension was not received.
 D. None of the above
Instructions for Form 9465
Use Form 9465 to request a monthly installment plan if you can't pay the full amount you owe shown on your tax return (or on a notice we sent you). Most installment agreements meet our streamlined installment agreement criteria. The maximum term for a streamlined agreement is 72 months. In certain circumstances, you can have longer to pay or you can establish an agreement for an amount that is less than the amount of tax you owe.
However, before requesting an installment agreement, you should consider other less costly alternatives, such as getting a bank loan or using available credit on a credit card. If you have any questions about this request, call 1-800-555-5555.

You want to request an online payment agreement (see "Applying online for a payment agreement"), or
Your business is still operating and owes employment or unemployment taxes. Instead, call the telephone number on your most recent notice to request an installment agreement.
