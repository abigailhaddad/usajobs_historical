(a) Experience. At least one year of creditable experience at the next lower grade level.

(b) Assignment. Employees serving at the full performance level function with independent judgment to administer and interpret recreation therapy assessments and utilize clinical competencies to develop unconventional assessment and interview approaches to effectively elicit information. They conduct, analyze, interpret, and report assessment data based upon functional domains (cognitive, sensory, social, affective, physical, and leisure). Incorporating the four-step process of assessment, planning, implementation, and evaluation of services delivered, the therapist constructs evidence-based recreation therapy interventions for treating patients with complex medical or mental health issues, such as polytrauma, traumatic brain injury (TBI), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), spinal cord injury (SCI), substance use disorder/addictions, serious mental illness (SMI), and hospice/palliative care requirements. They provide direct patient care and receive guidance from higher-level supervisory staff members for only the most complex patients and require only general supervision. They review recreation therapy consults and conduct comprehensive evaluations. Based upon the assessment data, and in collaboration with other stakeholders, the therapist develops individualized treatment plans with measurable therapeutic goals and objectives including scope, duration, and treatment. They recommend adaptation, modification, and/or assistive technology to meet a patient's assessed needs and preferences in recreation therapy. Through the use of activity/task analysis, behavioral interventions, and therapeutic procedures, the therapist designs individualized treatment interventions to reduce stress, anxiety, and maladaptive behaviors; recover basic motor functioning and reasoning abilities; build confidence; and develop compensatory strategies to master critical life skills necessary to re-enter the community in a productive manner. Sophisticated techniques/strategies used to improve or support clinical outcomes may include, but are not limited to: developing positive patterns of behavior; relaxation and stress reduction; lifestyle alteration; social skills training; developing or improving (enhancing) self-esteem; developing and maintaining positive relationships; motor learning and training strategies; anger and pain management; identify risks; recovery support; lifestyle adjustment; conflict/problem resolution; adjustment to disability; and including coping with grief and loss. Resourcefulness is exercised in providing individualized, unique, effective methods and procedures when implementing therapeutic interventions including, but not limited to: assistive technology; cognitive behavioral skills; aquatic therapy; fitness and wellness; community accessibility/reintegration/transition; and adapted sports and leisure development. Patient needs are evaluated for additional, alternative, or termination of services. Intervention plans are monitored for effectiveness, making modifications, as needed. Recreation therapists determine the effectiveness of protocols, modalities, and programs for targeted groups through quantitative analysis and identify potential risks and needs for adaptive interventions to facilitate improved biopsychosocial well-being. They participate in co-treatment opportunities, including but not limited to: neurological rehabilitation, mental health recovery programs, and palliative care related to the symptoms of a terminal illness. Discharge analysis and planning is conducted for community needs.

 No
