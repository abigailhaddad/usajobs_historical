This credited service can be used in determining the rate at which they earn annual leave. This position is covered by a Bargaining Unit. Frequent travel to the White Earth Service unit to complete MSA (Dental) tasks may be required. This position has promotion potential to the GS-06 grade level. Promotion to the next grade level is at management's discretion and is based on your demonstrated ability to perform the higher level duties, the continuing need for the higher level duties, and "Regulatory/Administrative" approval. Promotion to the next higher grade level is not guaranteed and no promise of promotion is implied.
