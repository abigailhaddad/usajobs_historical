Any extension request must be approved by the Chief of Mission. Per U.S. Mission Brazil / Embassy Brasilia Management Policy dated September 22, 2020: \"all USDH personnel seeking an extension of their tour must have Chief of Mission (COM) approval. Requests must be cleared and submitted to the Front Office a minimum of twelve months in advance of the original end date. To facilitate that process, Mission Brazil is implementing a quarterly review of other agency positions. Each quarter HR will contact the various agencies with USDH personnel posted in Brazil and provide a list of positions, encumbering personnel, and current tour end dates. This is an opportunity for the agencies to highlight any potential changes in the positions listed. Changes to tour lengths must be approved by the Chief of Mission prior to requesting such changes from agency headquarters, and acknowledgement of COM approval must be part of the request for agency approval. Please note that any change to the structure of the position (position grade, function, or location), would trigger the NSDD-38 process to change the conditions of the position, which is a different process outlined in Brasilia Management Instruction 15/021. To request an extension, a decision memo (Extension at Post Template) must be cleared by all offices listed and then approved by the COM. This memo must be cleared and sent to the Front Office at least twelve months prior to the original end of tour date as stated in the employee's assignment cable. Performance will be a factor in the extension process.\n\nRead more"

        "OtherInformation": "TSA may apply a sex-specific (male or female) hiring preference to fill TSO positions in order to meet security mission and same sex pat-down job-related requirements. At airport locations where it is necessary to apply the hiring preference, candidates of the needed sex will be provided preference in the scheduling of the computer-based aptitude test, airport assessments, processing and selection. The term \"sex\" refers to an individual's immutable biological classification as either male or female. Sex is not a synonym for and does not include the concept of \"gender identity.\" The term \"female\" refers to a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell. The term \"male\" refers to a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the small reproductive cell. Eligibility to apply for other Federal positions: TSA is an Excepted Service agency exempt from most of Title 5 United States Code, including regulations which apply to displaced Federal employees (CTAP/ICTAP) of other agencies, and employment with TSA does not confer \"Competitive Status\" that generally results from selection and service in Competitive Service agencies. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has established an Interchange Agreement, which allows most permanent TSA employees to apply and be considered for vacancies in Competitive Service agencies. Information from OPM on this or other Interchange Agreements is available at: http://www.opm.gov . TSA employees who are absent for the purpose of performing military duty may apply for any vacancies announced in their absence. More than one position may be filled from this announcement. DHS offers competitive salaries and an attractive benefits package, including: health, dental, vision, life, and long-term care insurance; retirement plan; Thrift Savings Plan [similar to a 401(k)]; Flexible Spending Account; Employee Assistance Program; personal leave days; and paid federal holidays. Other benefits may include flexible work schedules; telework; tuition reimbursement; transportation subsidies; uniform allowance; health and wellness programs; and fitness centers. DHS is committed to employee development and offers a variety of employee training and developmental opportunities. For more information, go to the DHS Careers website and select \"Benefits.\" Disabled veteran leave will be available to any Federal employee hired on or after November 5, 2016, who is a veteran with a service-connected disability rating of 30 percent or more. Employees who transfer to TSA from an agency that allows employees to maintain an annual leave balance higher than the maximum accumulation for the appointed position will have their leave ceiling set to the maximum accumulation for the appointed position (e.g., United States duty location - 240 hours, foreign duty location - 360 hours, or TSES position - 720 hours). TSA will not make a monetary payment for any leave forfeited under these circumstances. Starting a career with TSA as a TSO may lead to promotion possibilities within DHS.\n\nRead more"
