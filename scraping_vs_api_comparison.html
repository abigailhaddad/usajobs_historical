Education: Have a high school diploma, General Educational Development (GED), High School Equivalency Test (HiSET), or Test Assessing Secondary Completion (TASC) high school equivalency certificate.

If you are currently, or have been within the last 5 years, a political Schedule A, Schedule C, Non-career SES or Presidential Appointee employee in the Executive Branch, you must disclose this information to the Human Resources Office. Additional requirements: Occasional Travel Required: A minimum of three (3) weeks of travel in a full-time duty status may be required to complete TSA's New Hire training.

Therefore, former Federal or Postal Service employees who are receiving a civilian retirement annuity may have their salary reduced by the amount of their pension, which could result in a biweekly net pay as low as zero dollars ($0.00) or a debt owed to the Federal Government. TSO Dress and Appearance Responsibilities: TSOs must adhere to the current Master Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). For example, with the exception of half-inch diameter stud-style earrings, non-protruding ear gauges or spacers that match your skin and do not exceed one half-inch diameter, inconspicuous nose or tongue piercings that match your skin or tongue, body piercings may not be visible to the public. The CBA dictates if you have a tattoo that would be visible beyond the standard TSO uniform in areas such as the head and face including a partial tattoo that extends more than one inch beyond the upper neck or behind the ear, it could potentially render you ineligible for the position unless it was able to be covered at all times and not visible to the general public. Additionally, tattoos that are indecent, commonly associated with gangs, extremists, and/or supremacist organizations or that advocate sexual, racial, or religious discrimination, or have a negative impact on TSA's ability to carry out its mission must be covered at all times.

                            TSA may apply a sex-specific (male or female) hiring preference to fill TSO positions in order to meet security mission and same sex pat-down job-related requirements. At airport locations where it is necessary to apply the hiring preference, candidates of the needed sex will be provided preference in the scheduling of the computer-based aptitude test, airport assessments, processing and selection. The term "sex" refers to an individual's immutable biological classification as either male or female. Sex is not a synonym for and does not include the concept of "gender identity." The term "female" refers to a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell. The term "male" refers to a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the small reproductive cell. Eligibility to apply for other Federal positions: TSA is an Excepted Service agency exempt from most of Title 5 United States Code, including regulations which apply to displaced Federal employees (CTAP/ICTAP) of other agencies, and employment with TSA does not confer "Competitive Status" that generally results from selection and service in Competitive Service agencies. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has established an Interchange Agreement, which allows most permanent TSA employees to apply and be considered for vacancies in Competitive Service agencies. Information from OPM on this or other Interchange Agreements is available at: http://www.opm.gov . TSA employees who are absent for the purpose of performing military duty may apply for any vacancies announced in their absence. More than one position may be filled from this announcement. DHS offers competitive salaries and an attractive benefits package, including: health, dental, vision, life, and long-term care insurance; retirement plan; Thrift Savings Plan [similar to a 401(k)]; Flexible Spending Account; Employee Assistance Program; personal leave days; and paid federal holidays. Other benefits may include flexible work schedules; telework; tuition reimbursement; transportation subsidies; uniform allowance; health and wellness programs; and fitness centers.

Disabled veteran leave will be available to any Federal employee hired on or after November 5, 2016, who is a veteran with a service-connected disability rating of 30 percent or more. Employees who transfer to TSA from an agency that allows employees to maintain an annual leave balance higher than the maximum accumulation for the appointed position will have their leave ceiling set to the maximum accumulation for the appointed position (e.g., United States duty location - 240 hours, foreign duty location - 360 hours, or TSES position - 720 hours). TSA will not make a monetary payment for any leave forfeited under these circumstances. Starting a career with TSA as a TSO may lead to promotion possibilities within DHS.

                            TSA may apply a sex-specific (male or female) hiring preference to fill TSO positions in order to meet security mission and same sex pat-down job-related requirements. At airport locations where it is necessary to apply the hiring preference, candidates of the needed sex will be provided preference in the scheduling of the computer-based aptitude test, airport assessments, processing and selection. The term "sex" refers to an individual's immutable biological classification as either male or female. Sex is not a synonym for and does not include the concept of "gender identity." The term "female" refers to a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell. The term "male" refers to a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the small reproductive cell. Eligibility to apply for other Federal positions: TSA is an Excepted Service agency exempt from most of Title 5 United States Code, including regulations which apply to displaced Federal employees (CTAP/ICTAP) of other agencies, and employment with TSA does not confer "Competitive Status" that generally results from selection and service in Competitive Service agencies. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has established an Interchange Agreement, which allows most permanent TSA employees to apply and be considered for vacancies in Competitive Service agencies. Information from OPM on this or other Interchange Agreements is available at: http://www.opm.gov.
