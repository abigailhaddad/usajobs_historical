# Scraping Analysis Summary

## Current Status

### What We're Getting with Enhanced Scraping:
1. **Successfully extracting needed content** (7-10 out of 11 target sections)
   - majorDuties ✓
   - qualifications ✓
   - education ✓ 
   - howToApply ✓
   - evaluations ✓
   - benefits ✓
   - additionalInfo ✓
   - requirements ✓
   - requiredDocuments ✓
   - whatToExpectNext ✓
   - specializedExperience (sometimes included in qualifications)

2. **Wasting effort on redundant data** (already in historical API):
   - salary_info → use minimumSalary, maximumSalary, payScale
   - location_info → use locations field
   - dates → use positionOpenDate, positionCloseDate
   - agency_info → use hiringAgencyName, hiringDepartmentName
   - work_schedule → use workSchedule
   - security_clearance → use securityClearance

### What We're NOT Getting (gaps):
- Some sections have incomplete extraction
- specializedExperience not always captured separately
- Content sometimes truncated or mixed with other sections

## Optimized Approach

### Focus ONLY on content missing from historical API:

**High-Value Content Sections:**
- **majorDuties**: Job responsibilities (avg 1,300 chars)
- **qualifications**: Required qualifications (avg 1,200 chars)  
- **howToApply**: Application process (avg 3,100 chars)
- **requirements**: Employment conditions (avg 5,800 chars)
- **requiredDocuments**: Application documents (avg 2,800 chars)
- **additionalInfo**: Important details (avg 2,300 chars)
- **education**: Education requirements (avg 330 chars)
- **evaluations**: Evaluation criteria (avg 540 chars)
- **benefits**: Benefits info (avg 530 chars)
- **whatToExpectNext**: Next steps (avg 680 chars)

**Total Average Content**: ~18,000 characters per job

### Stop Extracting (use historical API instead):
- Position title
- Salary/grade information
- Location data
- Agency/department names
- Dates
- Work schedule
- Travel requirements
- Security clearance level

## Recommendations

1. **Use the optimized scraper** that focuses only on content sections
2. **Combine with historical API** data for complete job records
3. **Expected extraction rate**: 85-95% of content sections
4. **Processing efficiency**: Reduced by ~40% by eliminating redundant extraction

## Integration Strategy

```python
# Pseudocode for complete job data
job_data = {
    # From Historical API
    **get_historical_api_data(control_number),
    
    # From Optimized Scraping  
    'content_sections': scrape_job_content(control_number),
    
    # Combined for analysis
    'complete_record': True
}
```
